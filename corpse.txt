What makes somebody a criminal?\u00a0 Given that the subtext of the request contains a threat to refer the matter to ICANN if we don\u2019t play along, this is a non-trivial question. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but I always thought it was something that gets decided in a\u00a0<em><strong>c</strong><strong>ourt of</strong> <strong>law</strong></em>, as opposed to \u201csome guy on the internet\u201d sending emails. While that\u2019s <a href=\"http://torrentfreak.com/uk-police-orders-registrars-to-suspend-domains-of-major-torrent-sites-131009/\" target=\"_blank\">plenty reason enough for some registrars to take down domain names</a>, it doesn\u2019t fly here.</p>\n<p>We have an obligation to our customers and we are bound by our Registrar Accreditation Agreements <em>not</em> to make arbitrary changes to our customers settings without a <em>valid </em>FOA (Form of <em>Authorization</em>). To supersede that we need a <strong>legal</strong> basis. To get a legal basis something has to happen <strong><em>in</em><em> court.</em></strong></p>\n<p>The request also suggests we look at the whois contact information for the domain (which looks perfectly valid) and go ahead and suspend the domain based on invalid whois data. Again, there\u2019s a <em><strong>process</strong></em> for that, you have to go through the <a href=\"http://www.icann.org/en/resources/compliance/complaints/whois/inaccuracy-form\" target=\"_blank\">ICANN Whois Inaccuracy Complaint </a>process and most of the time that doesn\u2019t result in a takedown anyway.</p>\n<p>What gets me about all of this is that the largest, most egregious perpetrators of online criminal activity right now are our own governments, spying on their own citizens, illegally wiretapping our own private communications and <em>nobody cares</em>, nobody will answer for it, it\u2019s just an out-of-scope conversation that is expected to blend into the overall background malaise of our ever increasing serfdom.</p>\n<p>If I can\u2019t make various governments and law enforcement agencies get warrants or court orders before they crack my private communications then I can at least\u00a0 require a court order before I takedown my own customer.</p>\n<p>Before anybody tells me \u201cthis is just some bittorrent domain, just take it down\u201d, remember what we said back in 2010: <a title=\"First they came for the file-sharing domains\u2026\" href=\"https://www.easydns.com/blog/2010/11/27/first-they-came-for-the-file-sharing-domains/\" target=\"_blank\">First They Came For the File Sharing Domains</a>.</p>\n<p>About a week after that was posted Senator Lieberman and friends went batshit crazy trying to take down wikileaks. Why? Egregious truth telling. Again, this is the entire point of <em><strong>due</strong> <strong>process</strong></em>\u00a0<strong><em/></strong>it\u2019s there to keep us collectively away from the top end of the slippery slope.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, we\u2019re\u00a0 most of the way down that slope and into the mud of blatant mass online surveillance \u2013 the next phase will be concerted repression of inconvenient truth-tellers and facts.</p>\n<h2>Further Reading</h2>\n\n<h2>Update:</h2>\n<p>We took a look at <span><a href=\"http://83.138.166.114/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://83.138.166.114/</a></span> \u2013 the IP address they wanted us to redirect all of this domain\u2019s traffic to.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.easydns.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Screen-Shot-2013-10-08-at-12.40.20-PM.png\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-3284\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2013-10-08 at 12.40.20 PM\" src=\"http://www.easydns.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Screen-Shot-2013-10-08-at-12.40.20-PM-300x243.png\"/></a>Note that they are <strong>promoting</strong> paid, <strong>commercial</strong> alternatives to the websites they want us to takedown.</p>\n<p>In other words, they are <em>ordering us</em> to take down <em>competing</em> websites, with <strong>no legal basis</strong>, <span><em>hijacking</em></span> the traffic, and redirecting it to <span>competing commercial services</span>, all of which are based out of (guess where?) <strong>London, UK</strong>.</p>\n<p>And here they are complaining about \u201cprofiting from illegal activity\u201d.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2>Update #2</h2>\n<p>I\u2019ve seen a few comments around the internet that this was so over-the-top <em>wrong</em> that it couldn\u2019t be real and was probably an elaborate phishing attempt.</p>\n<p>I too suspected as much, so I looked at the headers before writing this post, it looks like the real deal:</p>\n<p><code/></p>\n<p>Return-Path: &lt;PIPCUantipiracy@city-of-london.pnn.police.uk&gt;</p>\n<p>X-Original-To: markjr@[redacted]</p>\n<p>Delivered-To: markjr@[redacted]</p>\n<p>X-Greylist: Passed host: 212.62.5.146</p>\n<p>X-Greylist: Passed host: 212.62.5.146</p>\n<p>Received: from mail.pnn.police.uk (mail.pnn.police.uk [212.62.5.146])</p>\n<p>(using TLSv1 with cipher DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA (256/256 bits))</p>\n<p>(No client certificate requested)</p>\n<p>by c3po.easydns.com (Postfix) with ESMTP id 8720F8B7DB;</p>\n<p>Tue, 8 Oct 2013 07:01:14 -0400 (EDT)</p>\n<p>From: PIPCUantipiracy &lt;PIPCUantipiracy@city-of-london.pnn.police.uk&gt;</p>\n<p>To: \"'erol@[redacted]\" &lt;erol@[redacted]&gt;</p>\n<p>CC: \"'markjr@[redacted]'\" &lt;markjr@[redacted]&gt;</p>\n<p>Subject: Website domain name suspension request #2 (NOT PROTECTIVELY MARKED)</p>\n<p>Thread-Topic: Website domain name suspension request #2 (NOT PROTECTIVELY</p>\n<p>MARKED)</p>\n<p>Thread-Index: Ac7EFX3SXZveCQEuR6ePpq8AuQZZkg==</p>\n<p>Date: Tue, 8 Oct 2013 11:00:05 +0000</p>\n<p>Message-ID: &lt;E3C2DE70C528F04096144CDA1C81C335029F76@CP8-DAG01.city-of-london.police.uk&gt;</p>\n<p>Accept-Language: en-GB, en-US</p>\n<p>Content-Language: en-US</p>\n<p>X-MS-Has-Attach: yes</p>\n<p>X-MS-TNEF-Correlator:</p>\n<p>x-officeenforcer-classification-impactlevel: 0</p>\n<p>x-officeenforcer-classification: NOT PROTECTIVELY MARKED</p>\n<p>x-originating-ip: [172.29.4.107]</p>\n<p>Content-Type: multipart/mixed;</p>\n<p>boundary=\"_004_E3C2DE70C528F04096144CDA1C81C335029F76CP8DAG01cityoflon_\"</p>\n<p>MIME-Version: 1.0</p>\n<p>X-OriginalArrivalTime: 08 Oct 2013 11:00:05.0750 (UTC) FILETIME=[8BB3D960:01CEC415]</p>\n<p>X-ACL-Warn: X-Virus Scan: F-Secure 9</p>\n<p>X-PNN3-Rtr: dnslookup</p>\n<p/>\n<p>Looks like it really did originate from the London Police servers.</p>\n<h2>Update #3</h2>\n<p>A friend emailed me and said that after reading this post, it wasn\u2019t crystal clear what we did about this or what our policy is. I\u2019ve seen a couple comments (<a href=\"http://news.slashdot.org/story/13/10/08/1814236/police-demand-summary-domain-takedown-traffic-redirection\" target=\"_blank\">slashdot story here</a>, etc) that seem to allude that the domain in question now points to the IP we mentioned.</p>\n<p>So just to clarify:</p>\n<p><strong>1) We haven\u2019t taken down the domain.</strong></p>\n<p>2) We told them to get a court order.</p>\n<p>Also, some people have observed that our own AUP mentions copyright infringement as grounds for termination. This is true and we have referred to\u00a0 it in the past in cases where the domain was actually hosting copyrighted material and refusing or ignoring legitimate takedown requests for that material.</p>\n<p>That said, our AUP states clearly: <em>What constitutes a violation of our AUP is at the sole discretion of easyDNS.</em> I cannot possibly imagine who else should be the final arbiters of that. An AUP and ToS is an agreement between the customer and the service provider. It is not a mechanism for third-parties to shoehorn their whims into somebody else\u2019s affairs. If you want to do that, get a court order.</p>\n<h2>Update #4</h2>\n<p>It also occurs to us that any registrars that <em>did </em>comply with these requests <a href=\"https://www.easydns.com/blog/2013/10/10/registrars-that-complied-with-shakedown-requests-may-now-be-in-violation-of-icann-transfers-policy/\">may now be in violation of the ICANN transfers policy</a> if they don\u2019t let those domains transfer away.</p>\n<h2>Update #5</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.easydns.com/blog/2013/10/29/tdrp-proceedings-initiated-in-response-to-uk-police-shakedown/\" target=\"_blank\">We have initiated a Transfer Dispute Resolution Process against another registrar </a>who has complied with these takedown requests and will not let 3 domains transfer-away to easyDNS.</p>\n<h2>Update #6</h2>\n<p>It was a long haul, but the NAF panel found in our favor and <a href=\"https://www.easydns.com/blog/2014/01/09/domains-locked-in-london-police-takedown-ordered-to-be-transferred/\">ordered the three domains locked down at another registrar to be transferred to easyDNS.</a></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n</div>\n</div></body></html>"}, "15430657": {"score": 1, "comments": [], "time": "2017-10-09 02:47:49", "url": "https://masterinvestor.co.uk/magazine/#dflip-65876/20/", "text": "<body id=\"readabilityBody\">&#13;\n<center><h1>403 Forbidden</h1></center>&#13;\n<hr/><center>nginx</center>&#13;\n</body>&#13;\n"}, "15431170": {"score": 2, "comments": [], "time": "2017-10-09 05:15:08", "url": "https://www.itwire.com/open-sauce/80256-the-algorithm-did-it-facebook-s-stamos-tries-to-shift-blame.html", "text": "<html><body><div><div class=\"itemIntroText\">\n<p>Facebook's chief security office Alex Stamos has taken to the digital airwaves (read Twitter) to try and counter the assumption that the social media giant is sitting on its hands when it comes to preventing the spread of fake news on its channels.</p>&#13;\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"itemFullText\">\n<p>But perhaps he should have sat down and composed a more sober response in a long-form essay, rather than write what appear to be a series of disjointed tweets - they aren't even numbered in the way people normally do when they tweet something that crosses over into multiple stanzas.</p>&#13;\n<p>Facebook has been under pressure ever since it was found that numerous posts on its website had been works of fiction that spread canards about the Democrats in the run-up to last year's presidential election.

I'm not sure who asked any vendor to fashion the world we live in; the vendors do it because they want to make money, lots of it. Snap out of it Alex, nobody vested you with this or any other task.</p>&#13;\n<p>Stamos has been particularly critical of journalists. \"If your piece assumes that a problem hasn't been addressed because everybody at these companies is a nerd, you are incorrect,\" <strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/alexstamos/status/916698696124788736\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">runs</a></strong> another tweet.</p>&#13;\n<p>My assumption, dear Alex, is that problems are not addressed because it would cost money and reduce your profits.

The explosive growth of the industrial revolution, the reordering of society in the enlightenment, and everything we call modern and progressive is associated with a sequence of events that is also tightly correlated with the birth of peer review. Most philosophers of science don&#x27;t consider this a coincidence. Science gave birth to exponential progress, and science itself is dependent on peer review.<p>Maybe the integration of peer review into practical industries, medical studies, and government regulation came later. But those were cases of taking something that worked astonishingly well and apply it to other domains. It&#x27;s hardly fair to say that peer review &quot;started&quot; in the 1960&#x27;s or 70&#x27;s.", "The key word is: informally<p>Formal peer review seems to encourage collective backscratching and discourage new ideas (even though some places do anonymous PR, it&#x27;s not hard to guess where it&#x27;s coming from if you&#x27;re a specialist on the area and familiar with the most prominent labs)", "I can confirm that it is very easy to determine who your anonymous reviewers are in specialist areas. In one topic that I used to publish in, I could easily identify one or two of the three reviewers. The main tells are when the reviewer brings up their tangentially related niche interests (e.g. how does this compare to method X or have you considered the effects of &lt;relatively obscure phenomenon&gt;).", "Just for the sake of solidity, would you care to have a citation there?", "Ironically there&#x27;s some given in the article.", "Isaac Asimov\u2019s New Guide to Science.", "The blog indicates this quite clearly and is speaking of only the formal, modern and monetized usage of it.  Science itself is basically useless without some type of peer review in whatever form.", "What I&#x27;m taking issue with is this:<p>&gt; But even if peer review is ancient, &quot;peer review&quot; itself is quite new.<p>Google charts about the history of usage of a particular grouping of terms is not definitive evidence about the history of the underlying activity named by that phrase. Peer review is indeed ancient and fundamental to science and scientific progress. It just may not have been talked about as broadly or referred to under different names before then. It&#x27;s hard to draw more than linguistic trivia out of that. It&#x27;s especially bad to make policy suggestions based on that.", "But that&#x27;s the author&#x27;s point. This current thing we call peer review isn&#x27;t what&#x27;s fundamental to science, the broader concept is. The modern for-profit journal system is not the only way to do science, and just because it cloaks itself in the name &quot;peer review&quot; doesn&#x27;t make it the only sort of peer review that facilitates good science.", "Maybe I&#x27;ve missed the author&#x27;s point, but you&#x27;ve also missed mine. The fact that the phrase &quot;peer review&quot; dates to the 1970&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t mean the concept wasn&#x27;t in use before. It was just called something else (&quot;refereeing&quot; as someone else in this thread pointed out).<p>Also, the sharp discontinuity in 1970-1980 is suspiciously close to the wide-scale deployment of computers. Probably has a lot more to do with data-availability biases in the corpus used by Google to construct these ngrams data sets from the transition to digital in industry and publishing.", "&quot;Peer review&quot; originally meant the scientific concept of reviewing your peers, formally or otherwise.  Currently that is not the dominant usage.  For example, perelmans proof of the poincare theorem is not &quot;peer reviewed&quot; in the contemporary parlance because it was dumped on arxiv, and not published in a journal with a structured system of presumptive validation.  It would be silly to claim that his work is not&#x2F;will not be reviewed by his peers -- &quot;peer review&quot; in the classic sense.", "I&#x27;m a bit older than most people here. I mention that because it may be relevant.<p>I&#x27;m entirely unfamiliar with the work you mentioned. So, I&#x27;m going to use just your description of events and work with that.<p>I&#x27;d say that their work was currently under review. After people have reviewed it and written about it, I&#x27;d say it was peer reviewed. Once it had been heavily reviewed, I&#x27;d probably say it had been formally peer reviewed.<p>Had it gone through a journal, I&#x27;d simply say it was reviewed prior to publication. After publication would be where I&#x27;d call it peer reviewed, after it has been published and commented on. Pre-publication review isn&#x27;t very rigorous. I really don&#x27;t put much emphasis on that.<p>To me, peer review happens post publication. Formal peer review would be when there is enough interest for people to make a concerted effort to replicate and dig deep into the findings to seek flaws. General Relativity would be formally peer reviewed. The paper you mention would be undergoing peer review.<p>I am not asserting that my thinking is correct. I am mentioning this because I see a difference and I think your use of &#x27;currently&#x27; may be very important in understanding this.<p>In 1970, I would attend a reputable prep school. I would not complete my doctorate until 1991.<p>So, I suspect you&#x27;re onto something with your use of &#x27;currently.&#x27; If I understand your comment about the proof of the Poincare Theorem correctly, I&#x27;d say that it is (likely) being currently peer reviewed.<p>To try to sum this word salad up, I don&#x27;t see prepublication review as peer review in the scientific sense. To my mind, that happens after publication and with varied levels of formality.<p>So, I suspect you&#x27;re onto something when you mention current usage. Sorry for the novella and rambling nature of my post.", "it&#x27;s ok.  Generally if you post a sketchy scientific statement, say, something by an advocate of homeopathy, a common retort will be, &quot;it&#x27;s not in a peer-reviewed journal&quot;.  Of course in the vast majority of cases not being in a &quot;peer-reviewed journal&quot; is a sign that the work is shoddy, but those it comes at the expense of elevating the converse statement - that something in a &quot;peer-reviewed journal&quot; is necessarily of good scientific workmanship.<p>There is a weak connection between being in a &quot;peer-reviewed journal&quot;, having undergone sufficient peer review (in the classical sense), and possibly the irony is that the connection is has a negative correlation with profile at the high end.  (it&#x27;s probably positively correlated at the low end).", "There are three activities:<p>- critical feedback on papers<p>- hypermonetization (and deleterious siloing) of works often produced with government grants, leading to primarily academics only having ready access to papers, whom don\u2019t see the subscription costs as a burden to <i>them.</i><p>- disseminating only papers meeting a threshold to maintain quality of the journal<p>Maybe scientists and academics should seek to create and use equivalent quality peer &#x2F; committee adversalism but publish in open forum that operates based on donations.<p>Academia seems currently over-commercialised: industry getting cheap labor, undergrads going into debt and journals, law libraries and textbook companies making a killing by locking up knowledge behind a paywall. Research papers and case law should be available to the most people as possible for little or no cost.", "Why the emphasis on money?  The structural organization of science as a hierarchical enterpise with gatekeepers to advancement will result in these problems regardless of funding or commercialization.", "That organization itself is a consequence of the funding policy. There&#x27;s nothing else pushing scientists into a hierarchy, or at least nothing nearly as strong.", "Tying funding to it makes them much more acute though. Essentially forcing you to play by these rules in order to live.<p>Without being forced like this, many deadbeat fake journals would die and places like arxiv would flourish.", "Latin and French were the languages of science for quite a while. Arabic before that and Greek before that.<p>This is ignoring Eastern science intentionally.<p>They searched for &#x27;peer review.&#x27;<p>I don&#x27;t see any indication that they searched in other languages, what those phrases might be, and how they accounted for that.<p>Well, that and it looks like they are conflating two ideas. They appear to be speaking about more modern journals and ignoring that philosophers shared and published their work, sought students, and held their findings up for scrutiny.<p>So, not just the phrase part that you mention, but also the language used may impact this. I have no idea how to say peer review in either French or Latin and I <i>am</i> a scientist.", "One of the key factors missing in this discussion is that there are two overlapping forms of peer review: One which is merely technical, checking for correctness and completeness. The other is a much more subjective form, in which a reviewer is asked to comment on the &quot;merit&quot; or potential &quot;impact&quot; of a given study. The former is often necessary, as honestly there&#x27;s a lot of crap out there, but more often it comes down to minor details that the expertise of another scientist&#x27;s specialty can best address. The downside is that this can inspire a certain pedantry and pressure to undertake what is essentially unnecessary formatting.<p>The latter is essentially the real problem of science in its current state: prestige. There is no reason to not just publish everything in a mega-journal that doesn&#x27;t consider &quot;merit&quot;. It would mean more replication studies and less publication bias against &quot;negative&quot; results (i.e. this drug didn&#x27;t work as hoped). High-prestige journals also tend to charge correspondingly higher subscription fees, while adding nothing special to the scholarly ecosystem, beyond delaying (often by months) the eventual publication elsewhere. However careers are made on publishing in high-prestige journals.<p>A recent tweet makes one wonder what the value of high-prestige journals in the first place, if they don&#x27;t even bother to correct or improve the scholarly record. A PNAS editor&#x27;s rejection of a paper with greater statistical power and improved methodology, but which fails to replicate a highly cited PNAS paper was on the basis that &quot;in these days of computer literature searches, I see no reason a journal needs to feel compelled to publish follow-up papers on previously published work.

I&#x27;m a postdoc in the humanities and some of my colleagues publish 10+ bullshit papers in crappy journals per year - their career is virtually guaranteed, even though everybody knows and agrees that it&#x27;s impossible to write that much and maintain any level of quality. It doesn&#x27;t matter how bad or insignificant your work is, if you manage to push out 5+ Scopus-indexed articles per year, nobody will be able to fire you or overlook you in tenure track applications, and I see more and more people gaming the system in that way.<p>It&#x27;s leads to a horrible display of mediocricity, of course, and anyone with a genuine interest in substantial scientific research has a hard time competing.

I was surprised, a few years ago, in performing anachronism consulting for the show \"Masters of Sex,\" set in the early 1960s, to see my algorithms reject one character's suggestion that Masters and Johnson needed to publish in peer reviewed journals as hopelessly anachronistic. But that is indeed the case.\u00a0</span><span>Google Ngrams shows only sporadic uses\nbefore about 1970; the adjectival form \"peer reviewed,\" as adhering to scholarship, barely exists before 1980. (As always, you should basically ignore Google Ngrams results from after 2000, but why not include them?)</span>\n\n<span><br/></span>\n<span>Of course the thing may exist before the word: but one thing I've found invariably in looking at these etymologies is words usually do not march straight out of the primordial ooze into widespread use for no reason at all, particularly words describing so specific and unpoetic as a practice like this. Usually there is some reason, some new thing in the world that requires a new term to distinguish it from what has come before.</span>\n<span><br/></span>\n<span>So what new thing gave rise to peer review? Reading through the texts gives some sense. JStor contains no uses of the phrase until 1965, in reference\nto \u201cpeer review groups\u201d at the NIH. Through the late 1960s the phrase was only\nused in the context of doctors supervising medical care of other doctors. The\nfirst use outside of medicine I find is in 1969, in a library sciences context,</span><span>1 </span><span>also about\nprofessional self-evaluation. An early usage for grants is in 1970.</span><span>2\u00a0</span><span>The first usage of the phrase in the American Historical Review is in 1978, in a\ndecidedly negative evaluation of the \u201cpeer review bureaucracies of foundations\nand government,\u201d \u201cmanned by scientists of lesser achievement.\u201d</span>\n<span><br/></span><p>\nSo what is the new thing being described here? As best as I can tell, the reason for its existence is the rise of the new government funding bureaucracy in the 1960s; the NIH, the NSF, and their smaller cousins like the NEH all needed mechanisms to distribute their new government largess: and peer review was a way to ensure that government money was not handed out by the government, but by experts from the scientific community. (This story, by the way, bears an interesting relationship to the one I wrote earlier this month about </p><a href=\"http://sappingattention.blogspot.com/2017/07/what-is-described-as-belonging-to.html\">government attributes versus public ones</a><p>; that sentence would have a different valence if I said that scholars wished to ensure the \"public money was not handed out by the public.\") Its use in non-publication situations--peer review boards investigating medical malpractice, for example--is almost entirely about protecting professional organizations from state or other bureaucratic interference. And when there are large-scale discussions of peer review in science--as in a </p><a href=\"http://journals.sagepub.com/toc/sthd/10/3\">special 1985 edition of \"Science, Technology, and Human values,\"</a><p>\u00a0they frequently take grant-making as the archetypal form, not the refereeing of scholarship.\n</p><p>\nThe central technology that causes this new term to spread to scholarship, then, is the grantmaking state. But this relies on a more prosaic technology, as well. Peer review is the archetypal form of scholarly organization in the age of the xerox machine. Without it, a sheaf of grant proposal could not be easily snapped into a binder, mailed across the country, and then (perhaps) flown back to Washington with its expert reader for discussion.\n</p><p>\nDigging around a little recently, I see that historian of science Alex Czsisar wrote a short piece for Nature in 2016 (after I gave this as a talk, so not fully incorporated here) where he says this, which is very much along the same lines.\n</p><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">\n<span>'Peer review' was a term borrowed from the procedures that government agencies used to decide who would receive financial support for scientific and medical research. When 'referee systems' turned into 'peer review', the process became a mighty public symbol of the claim that these powerful and expensive investigators of the natural world had procedures for regulating themselves and for producing consensus, even though some observers quietly wondered whether scientific referees were up to this grand calling.</span></blockquote>\n<p>\nAll of this suggests, though it doesn't prove, that the shift to a language of \"peer review\" involves a model of research that draws on a nationally organized scientific funding system that merges with a series of older traditions. Most of the histories of peer review in the sciences note how late journals were to adopt it: leading British publications like the Lancet and Nature don't take up outside peer reviewers until the 1970s.</p>\n<p>\n<br/></p>\n<div><p>\nIf the history of peer review in the sciences is young, the history of peer review in the humanities is even younger. T</p><span>he earliest usage in the front-or-back matter of the American Historical Review that I see at first glance is from 1996, in describing who can perform book reviews; the second use outside a history-of-science context is in 1997, when Sheila Fitzpatrick notes unhappily that a book has obviously \"undergone extensive peer review\" in a way that weakens it, serving as an \"uncomfortable reminder that peer review may function not only as a gate-keeping procedure but also as a kind of censorship of unpopular opinions.\" (Here's <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23054375\">a similar 2012 argument</a> in favor of editorial review, *not* peer review, in a science journal). (Not far down the list is Ayers and Thomas's 2003 digital article \"The Differences Slavery Made;\" rather than showing up to challenge decades of consensus on peer review, digital scholarship was already arriving on the hardly after the consensus had set).</span>\n\n<span><span>I'd have to do more research to really understand what the outside review policies of leading journals were in the (say) 1950s and 1960s. I have the impression, but have lost the reference, that at least single-copy referee reviewing was common, if not mandatory, in the period. (\"Outside referee,\" though, is another 1960s neologism.) Still, the technology of mimeographs and carbon copies makes for different forms of outside review: In 1956, the <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/1848581?Search=yes&amp;resultItemClick=true&amp;searchText=%22carbon%20copy%22&amp;searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3Ffilter%3Djid%253A10.2307%252Fj100010%26amp%3BQuery%3D%2522carbon%2Bcopy%2522&amp;refreqid=search%3A4774cf3ea701092e473e6c5d6bac3339&amp;seq=2#page_scan_tab_contents\">AHR only demanded a single paper copy of each article</a> submitted. (The ribbon copy, please; keep the carbon copy for yourself.) This <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/1848020?seq=4#page_scan_tab_contents\">seems to have been still true in 1970</a>; I suppose by then the AHR could have been paying for photocopies on their own, but I doubt they did. By 1980, the number of required copies number has increased to 2; by the late 1990s, the frontmatter demanded four, or a Microsoft-compatible disk, which is what it would take for a really modern peer review system. But surely I've said enough now that someone will chime in in the comments about how mimeographs were sent to various reviewers in serial.</span></span>\n<span><br/></span>\n<span>I know even less about monographs; but it should be widely known that some important work in the field *continues* to be published as part of edited volumes, trade presses, and other channels subject only to editorial review, not peer review.</span>\n<span><br/></span>\n<span>So what? Obviously peer review didn't *really* come into being in the historical profession in 1995. That's ridiculous! Books and journals had various forms of outside referees in the mimeograph/carbon copy age as well. But the point is this: something did change, and more recently than we might think. Peer review was created, rather than always existing in the humanities; its rhetorical adoption in those fields as a core term may be less connected to eternal ideas of scholarship, and have more to do with the effort to make them more like the sciences in the postwar university. Be skeptical of the administrative-ese, buzzword-inflected vogue for the digital humanities all you want: but also, be aware that if you say \"peer review is fundamental to sound scholarship,\" you're speaking in the buzzwords of not long ago, yourself.</span>\n<p>\nI wouldn't argue in good faith that peer review is new, so it's bad. It might be that the scholarly practices from 1970 to 2010 are indeed worth preserving.</p></div>\n<p>\nBut at the same time, I'm not sure that digital scholarship could ever fully reconcile itself to peer review in the traditional sense without transforming it enough that we'll need a whole new phrase to describe the new regime to come.<br/>\n<br/></p>\n<p>\nRandomly selected bibliography:\n</p><p>\nSome early citations, and some previous histories.</p><span><br/></span>\n<span><br/></span><span>\u201cAtlantic City Conference: A Great Show\u2013in Two Parts and a Cast of Thousands.\u201d </span><span>ALA Bulletin </span><span>63, no. 7 (): 915\u2013964. http://www.jstor.org/stable/\n25698237.\n</span>\n<span><br/></span>\n\n     <span>Cooper, Joseph D. \u201cOnward the Management of Science: The Wooldridge Report.\u201d </span><span>Science </span><span>148, no. 3676.

Graff in his new book \u2018Raven Rock: The Story of the US Government\u2019s Secret Plan to Save Itself\u2019 claims that all of the administrations in the years of the Cold War were well aware that Russia could annihilate the population of the United States if they decided to launch a nuclear strike. While they told the people that they believed that a nuclear strike was survivable, they realized that there was no way that they could viably protect the population. Graff writes that their conclusion was to ensure that they could protect themselves while leaving the rest of the country to their fate.</span></span></p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\n\t\u00a0</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\n\t<span><span>Secretly, the government set about building some facilities inside America\u2019s mountains that were capable of surviving a nuclear blast. There were also a huge number of renovations made to the White House and all of the staff members were issued with gas masks. It is alleged that Roosevelt had his gas mask on hand at all times as it was attached to his wheelchair. A bunker was also built underneath the lawn of the White House which was capable of housing 100 people in the event of a nuclear strike. While this secret bunker was never actually used in the course of the Cold War, it was opened and occupied during September 11th to ensure the safety of the President and key personnel.</span></span></p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\n\t\u00a0</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\n\t<span><span>In addition to the bunker underneath the White House, the government also constructed several other nuclear-proof facilities. One is located at Raven Rock in Pennsylvania and is believed to be linked to Camp David by a secret tunnel. In addition to the famous facility in Colorado Springs which is operated by NORAD there are also two facilities located in Peters Mountain and Mount Weather (both in Virginia) which are designated to house top officials of the US government and 6500 other individuals who are considered essential to rebuild the country in the event of a disaster.</span></span></p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\n\t\u00a0</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\n\t<span><span>In his book, Graff also reveals the extent to which the United States was prepared to destroy Russia in a nuclear war. The Pentagon is alleged to have drawn up a list of forty-nine Russian cities that they would destroy in the event of a nuclear war to completely paralyze the Soviet Union. It was this report that set in process the arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union. At the time it was written, the United States had only thirteen nuclear warheads. Now the country is in possession of an astonishing 6800 nuclear weapons.</span></span></p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\n\t\u00a0</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\n\t\u00a0</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\n\t<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DeJsKHT2iIE\">VIDEO</iframe></p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\n\t\u00a0</p> \n                            </div>\n</div></body></html>"}, "15430668": {"score": 64, "comments": ["Is it just me or are more and more stories which look like fluff pieces for ZCash coming up on the HN frontpage?

Monero, is a private company and consciously spending time, money and effort on brand-building and PR.<p>Nothing really weird with that IMO.", "For the record, someone who gives an interview to a journalist almost never gets a say over what headline it gets published under. Did you read the article? I really liked the way it came out!<p>Also for the record, we didn&#x27;t ask Assange or Snowden to start accepting donations in Zcash or anything.

I don&#x27;t actually agree with him, and I question if he truly believes those answers, but I was interested to read his public opinions.", "The unfortunate thing to me about Zcash is that privacy is opt-in. It would be like if Signal was default no privacy, but then you could enable it per message if you wanted to send something secret. Governments could just ban you from turning the privacy on and we&#x27;ve already seen this happen with TOR. Opting into privacy &quot;raises suspicion&quot;, and we need services where privacy is enabled by default. Monero does this.", "you can interpret this as a problem and as a solution too. Yes, ztransactions will could dye your money so no exchange will accept it because you are a terrorist and the US can ban the usage of ztransactions.\nIn my opinion it&#x27;s better like this, since the overall goal is to not rely on exchanges and regulatory thirdparties.

All people present in the trusted setup would have to be colluding or be compromised to cause an issue.<p>2.

It&#x27;s down to 6 people not having colluded at one point in time in the past, each having been scrutinized during the procedure, with post-hoc inspection of the software and hardware. If those 6 people decided at any point after the procedure that they wanted to collude, then it would be too late for them to do so.<p>Essentially they each produced a private key, and if each of them revealed their private key to the same party then that party could derive a master private key that would allow them to (among other things) mint Zcash for free (privacy wouldn&#x27;t be broken).

I didn&#x27;t try too hard to identify them but Tom Elvis Jedusor is the French name of Lord Voldemort. This is an important feature for privacy focused coins and for cryptocurrency as a political statement (not just as a technology).<p>3) The website, by eschewing flashy web2.0 design and and buzzwords, clearly sets itself apart from the typical &quot;lets get rich quick&quot; coin. Although I am disappointed the white paper isn&#x27;t done in LaTeX.<p>Reasons I&#x27;m skeptical (perhaps you can address these):<p>1) Missed the boat on first mover advantage. Monero seems to solve the privacy problem good enough. Perhaps it is unreasonable to expect people to completely swap over to a new coin whenever there&#x27;s an advance in tech. Especially when word of the new coin has to spread through grass roots instead of a centralized mechanism.<p>2) Elliptic curve crypto is vulnerable to quantum computers. IMO this is a ticking time bomb.<p>3) Expanding on point 2, bitcoin intentionally made a habit of layering &quot;proven&quot; crypto methods on top of each other. Eg both SHA256 and RIPEMD160 hash functions are used so that if a weakness is found in one hash the other is still ok. So far as I can tell mimblewimble has a single point of failure (elliptic curve cryptography).", "&gt; Reasons I&#x27;m skeptical (perhaps you can address these):<p>1) Monero may have first mover advantage in the privacy realm, but at the cost of prunability. Grin not only avoids that cost but further improves prunability beyond bitcoin. To me the first mover advantage will always belong to bitcoin, which will likely adopt privacy improving features in the long term.<p>2+3) Indeed; when evidence appears of quantum computers becoming feasible at breaking EC crypto, current blockchains will need to adopt post-quantum crypto methods of signing transactions, and migrate existing balances. Since EC crypto is more heavily ingrained into Grin, it may have a much harder time than the more modular bitcoin design, or even find it impossible to do so. I&#x27;m not aware of any post-quantum equivalent to Pedersen commitments.\nMy hope is that quantum computer development runs into insurmountable barriers...", "I really don&#x27;t like the reliance on the Ceremony to prevent counterfeiting, but it is the only way science has yet discovered for how to enable full-strength (encryption-based) privacy. Fortunately, science continues to advance and I hope we&#x27;ll be able to upgrade to a trapdoor-free cryptographic proof system someday.", "The other issue with zcash is an ever growing double-spend list. Monero also suffers this flaw, unfortunately. If either one scaled up to just bitcoin&#x27;s level of activity, there&#x27;d be severe problems.<p>Mimblewimble is far more likely to be a lasting privacy gain since the technology it is built upon, Blockstream&#x27;s confidential transactions, has properties more like Bitcoin&#x27;s in this regard, and perhaps even better as you can sync from a partially-pruned history.", "Could you elaborate on this flaw, or perhaps point to a link - especially with regards to Monero?", "Yes, I&#x27;m pretty sure that neither Zcash or Monero allow double-spends. Wondering what the context of that statement could possibly be. Any successful cryptocurrency must solve the double-spend problem or there&#x27;s no value in the ledger at all.", "Here&#x27;s a stack exchange question:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;monero.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;2158&#x2F;what-is-moneros-mechanism-for-defending-against-a-double-spend-attack\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;monero.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;2158&#x2F;what-is-mone...</a><p>TL;DR Monero requires every transaction input to include a &quot;key image&quot; (an elliptic curve point, looks like a public key). The key image is deterministically constructed from the actual coin being spent, without actually revealing which one it is. So making sure the chain never contains a repeated key image is sufficient to make sure that no coin is ever spent more than once, without actually knowing whether any one specific coin is spent. This is how Monero achieves its inflation&#x2F;non-cloning guarantee.<p>(There was a famous double-spending bug in CryptoNote protocols you might have heard about that resulted in limitless inflation. This was because the Ed25519 signature scheme used has a co-factor of 8, a stupid performance &quot;enhancement&quot; that DJB should really re-think. As a result, a given key-image had a 1-in-8 chance of being malleable by adding a point of order 8. It&#x27;s fixed by checking that the key image is actually contained in the group. These sorts of unexpected consequences are why serious cryptographers don&#x27;t use co-factors other than 1, or other fiddly tricks that get you small constant implementation gains with risky not well studied trade-offs. This is also why the current push to standardize on DJB designed crypto solutions is borderline insanity. But I digress.)<p>The mathematics of what zerocash does is wildly different, but it serves essentially the same purpose. Each private&#x2F;anonymous spend in zerocash has some bits associated with it that are generated in a non-linking way from the input being spent. As long as there are never two transactions in the entire block chain history with the same value for this field, there are no double-spends.<p>-----<p>The problem is that these can never go away. In bitcoin if a coin is spent, you can prune knowledge of that coin from your local history. This is what the &quot;-prune&quot; option does in recent versions of Bitcoin Core. You still need to receive and process the transaction once when you sync the chain, but you can then throw it away if you are space constrained. Mimblewimble potentially improves the situation even better by boiling down each transaction to just a single EC point, the script kernel, such that a client needs only the current UTXO set and the full history of all these kernels to do initial sync. The rest of the data can well and truly be forgotten. But although those kernels are needed for initial sync, pruning nodes can throw them away afterwards. They are not needed for the validation of future blocks in any way.<p>TL;DR: The amount of data a verifier needs to keep around to validate a new block in bitcoin depends only on the number of unspent outputs. The full block chain is only needed for initial sync. This is asymptotically O(current size of bitcoin ecosystem). The amount of data needed by Monero or Zerocash, on the other hand, is (a constant factor of) the entire block chain used by these systems. This is asymptotically O(every transaction ever). Monero and ZCash are chugging along now, but every single block found increases the amount of data a verifier needs to keep around. That doesn&#x27;t scale....", "Very good summary of the issue.  This is actually a solveable problem. You use a tree of spent serial numbers  and non-membership proofs. This basically eliminates the over head to the network of managing serial numbers and checking for double spends. However, it requires they be stored somewhere because some of that data is needed to make non-membership proofs and update the tree.  To further reduce it, keep separate serial number data structures per some long epoch and reveal which epoch a coin was create in on spending. Now the burden epochs is only one people with coins in that epoch. For most reasonable scales, epochs can be very very long. Like 10 years.<p>As an aside, the fact that mimbelwimble does not have this issue should make you wonder just how much privacy it provides.", "That doesn\u2019t solve the issue. It just pushes the responsibility of holding all this data onto the signer instead of the validator, which is a free choice. But signers are usually more space constrained than validators.<p>And there is no connection between privacy guarantees and this issue. I\u2019m not sure what you\u2019re getting at there.", "Thank you very, very much for that long and thorough answer. I need to read it through more thoroughly when I return from work. But sounds like I may need to re-think my holdings of Monero :)", "Mimblewimble used properly gets nearly the same benefits that you have in Monero (essentially non interactive coinjoin) but with scaling guarantees better than bitcoin. If it was possible to ring signatures like Monero has without the scaling difficulties, I guarantee you bitcoin developers would be working on it. Friends don\u2019t let friends invest alt coins.", "Thanks a lot once more! I need to read that Mimblewimble white paper.<p>Haha yeah the last sentence came a bit late as I have lost some money on Monero. I may just hold them until they perhaps gets even and then sell. Just liked the philosophy and idea behind. But thanks anyway :)", "Doesn&#x27;t it scale? Isn&#x27;t it the case that the Merkle tree holding all the shielded coins can be pruned just as easily as the Merkle tree storing Bitcoin transactions?

In fact, I\u2019m 43 now, more than half of my life ago, I discovered these science papers by a scientist named <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Chaum\">David Chaum</a> who invented the notion of encrypted crypto currency, internet money that was protected by cryptography.\u201d, according to Zooko, \u201cIt didn\u2019t have a decentralized monetary base. There was a central third party but it couldn\u2019t spy on the transactions of the users because of cryptography. It wasn\u2019t a complete solution.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>David Chaum invented </em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecash\"><em>eCash</em></a><em>, as anonymous cryptographic electronic money in 1983. In 1990, he founded the </em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DigiCash\"><em>DigiCash </em></a><em>company for the implementation of eCash by third party corporations (mainly banks). The eCash solution ensures the privacy of its users. eCash was implemented by one bank in the US and a few banks in Europe.</em></p>\n<p><em>\u00a0<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3752\" src=\"https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/ecash.png\" alt=\"ecash\"/></em></p>\n<h2>It\u2019s all about Berlin\u2019s wall, internet and crypto</h2>\n<p>\u201cA couple of years before I came across David Chaum\u2019s invention, I discovered the internet. The internet was pretty new then. I thought it was really exciting that distance and national borders were no longer complete barriers to communication. Before the internet, people didn\u2019t really talk to, or learn the thoughts, of people from other countries. The only way was if you read a book or could take from whatever the newspapers or the TV stations chose to tell you about people\u2019s thoughts from other countries.</p>\n<p>Another formative event in my life was the fall of the Berlin Wall. It meant that national borders would stop being jail cells to people. In 1993, I discovered Cryptocurrency through DigiCash, and I thought this was the third part of the revolution; so distance and borders would no longer be barriers to resource sharing and going into business together \u2013 that one unfortunately didn\u2019t work out.\u201d</p>\n<p>In Zooko\u2019s vision, there are the three parts of the revolution \u2013 The fall of the Berlin wall, the invention of the internet and the invention of cryptocurrencies which represent a world with open borders, global open communication and an open economy without a distance or origin barrier.</p>\n<p><strong>INTERNET \u2013 Are we moving in the wrong direction?</strong></p>\n<p>\u201cYears later, the internet revolution started to roll back, it became more of the case that national borders are barriers to communication between people. It is profoundly the case in China. In the West we are used to using the internet, and it is like an extension of our brains. When I went to China it felt like having a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobotomy\">lobotomy</a>, I couldn\u2019t Google anything. No Facebook, no New-York Times, no Wikipedia\u2026 It is moving in the wrong direction.\u201c</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3755\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/censorship.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-3755\" src=\"https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/censorship.jpg\" alt=\"censorship\" srcset=\"https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/censorship.jpg 620w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/censorship-300x155.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Internet Censorship map (Source: www.isoc.org)</figcaption></figure>\n<h2>Bitcoin vs. Zcash</h2>\n<p>\u201cBitcoin and Zcash represent to me the third part that will help sustain the other two \u2013 <em>open borders and global open communication</em> \u2013 and will keep the internet open and global\u201d.</p>\n<p><strong>Our data is owned by private companies</strong></p>\n<p>\u201cThe potential for protecting and expanding human freedom is exciting. We are currently on a very dangerous pattern. The level of surveillance available for government is unprecedented in human history. Since humans were born until 15 years ago, there was never anything like that. There were cases throughout history when governments were more proactive in collecting data.</p>\n<p>Though, the modern large companies and the governments have way more data on us than the German secret police ever had. East German secret police had about one half of their citizens secretly reporting on the other half and they had buildings full of folders and files with the data of all the citizens in the country. But this is nothing compared to the data about us that Google owns today. There is a big difference if you have one data point from everyday compared to a data point of every micro-second.\u201d</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3756\" src=\"https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/cyber-security-2765707_640.jpg\" alt=\"cyber-security\" srcset=\"https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/cyber-security-2765707_640.jpg 640w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/cyber-security-2765707_640-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\"/></p>\n<p><strong>How is all of the above background related to Zcash</strong></p>\n<p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s really why I started Zcash 3 years ago, because I was concerned about these issues and thought Zcash could make a big difference\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Zcash explained to the normal human being</strong></p>\n<p>\u201cIt is a kind of money that doesn\u2019t come from any government or company and it protects the information about your transaction so that information is not disclosed to hackers or anyone. That\u2019s basically Zcash.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Tahoe LAFS</strong></p>\n<p>\u201cI made a company that made a cryptographically protected distributed storage system called, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tahoe-LAFS\">Tahoe LAFS</a>. That\u2019s a distributed encrypted storage system like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System\">IPFS</a>. Tahoe LAFS, which is still going on, is a very interesting project. One difference between it and IPFS is that the files are encrypted so you have control over who gets to see the content of them.</p>\n<p>Another thing that the startup does is security audits for cryptographic software. For example, we were hired by the<strong> Ethereum </strong>development team before the launch of Ethereum to do security auditing of Ethereum. We were hired by many other good projects to do security audits.\u201d</p>\n<h2>I wanted to work on Zcash day and night for the rest of my life</h2>\n<p>\u201cOne day, a team of scientists from the USA and Israel, who developed the idea behind Zcash approached me and asked me to commercialize the new project. They knew of my previous work at Tahoe LAFS. At first I said no. Even though I thought privacy is really important to me and is important for society, Bitcoin had a head start. So this new thing (Zcash) would just be a niche product for special purposes and wouldn\u2019t be a mainstream product.\u201d</p>\n<p>However, after some deeper thinking, I realized that privacy is necessary for the mainstream users too and eventually I said Yes. And from that point, I wanted to work on Zcash day and night for the rest of my life. In addition to privacy\u2019s importance for humanity, civil rights and the safety of society is also necessary for business. \u00a0Every mainstream business that wants to use cryptocurrency will need it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you want to use a cryptocurrency to buy and sell goods and services for your business you need privacy so that you are not leaking information about your transactions to competitors, criminals and unauthorized parties. In the US, it is absolutely illegal for any business that manages customer\u2019s money, to leak information about it to an unauthorized party.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Fungibility</strong></p>\n<p>\u201cFor a thing to serve as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money\">money</a>, it needs to be transferable, easy to count, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungibility\">fungible</a>.</p>\n<p>If you are selling your used bike for 100 USD, and someone offers you two 100 USD bills, you probably don\u2019t care which one of them you take. Two 100 USD bills means the same to you. However, if you are selling your used bike and someone offers you one of two used laptops, you really care about which used laptop to take. No used laptop is worth exactly the same as another to you. That\u2019s why dollars have fungibility and used laptops don\u2019t have fungibility.\u201d</p>\n<h2>\u201cSome people don\u2019t trust JP Morgan\u201d</h2>\n<p><strong>What value does Bitcoin bring to the world?</strong><em>The question was asked a few days after </em><em>Jamie Dimon, </em><em>J.P. Morgan</em><em>\u2019s CEO, called Bitcoin a </em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/13/bitcoin-fraud-jp-morgan-cryptocurrency-drug-dealers\"><em>fraud</em></a></p>\n<p>\u201cI think the core value proposition is that some people don\u2019t trust JP Morgan. There isn\u2019t any government or a person that everyone on the planet trusts. One can say, let\u2019s make a world bank that everyone trusts. Fact is, that\u2019s not the world we live in. That is the unique value proposition of Bitcoin and Zcash, not the technology. But a thing that you and someone else can rely on, even though you and the other person don\u2019t trust the same bank or the same government. I love Bitcoin, it is a revolution.

A problem is that each of these new currencies are centrally controlled by one entity. This limits the scope of who will rely on that currency and how much value they will risk on that currency. There are ideas floating around about how to facilitate transactions between currencies, but this would not solve the problem. </em><em>A plethora of competing centralized services is not the same as a decentralized service.</em><em> Even if it were cheap and convenient to trade some LindenBucks for some WoW Gold, this would only lead us back to the equivalent of the modern nation-state currencies: mostly centralized (because of </em><em>the Network Externality</em><em>), heavily taxed/regulated/manipulated, and prone to disastrous failure. What I want is a currency which everyone can cheaply and conveniently use but which </em><strong><em>no-one</em></strong><em> has the power to manipulate. No-one has the power to inflate or deflate the currency supply, no-one has the power to monitor, tax, or prevent transactions. Truly the digital equivalent of gold, during the times and places when gold was the universal currency. See the </em><a href=\"http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2005/12/bit-gold.html\"><em>BitGold</em></a><em> idea by Nick Szabo and </em><a href=\"http://www.weidai.com/bmoney.txt\"><em>b-money</em></a><em> idea by Wei Dai, and recent effort to actually implement something along these lines: </em><a href=\"http://www.bitcoin.org/\"><em>BitCoin</em></a><em> by Satoshi Nakamoto.\u201d</em></p>\n<p><strong>What value does Zcash bring to the world that Bitcoin does not?</strong></p>\n<p>\u201cThere is a huge flaw in Bitcoin. Satoshi knew this, he also valued <strong>privacy</strong>. He talked about how he hoped Bitcoin\u2019s privacy would be sufficient and of the possible ways to improve its privacy using encryption. Bitcoin\u2019s privacy is a total failure. The only reason Satoshi didn\u2019t put better privacy into Bitcoin originally is that we didn\u2019t have sophisticated enough cryptography back then. It was after Satoshi was doing his work that we discovered the new mathematics of efficient Zero Knowledge Proofs that allow us to do it correctly in Zcash.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Zero Knowledge Proofs </strong></p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0</strong>\u201cZero Knowledge Proof is not what gives you privacy, it is just the necessary glue to allow us to use encryption. The way privacy is provided in Zcash is the same way privacy is provided with every high security computer and network (Secured databases of banks in the world for example). The reason transactions are public in Bitcoin is so the miners can detect invalid transactions and exclude them in order for Bitcoin to work. That\u2019s why Satoshi couldn\u2019t encrypt the transactions; otherwise he would have done it. The innovation of Zero Knowledge Proof allows us to prove that a transaction is valid even though the transaction is encrypted.</p>\n<p>It is an interesting discovery that was made about 30 years ago. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shafi_Goldwasser\"><strong>Shafi Goldwasser</strong></a> is one of the scientists behind this proof. She later won the Turing award for this discovery, which is one of the most prestigious awards for a computer scientist. They identified the concept of proving the solution without revealing the solution, and proved that it was possible to do it. But, the way that they showed that it was possible to do it, was totally impractical, that\u2019s why Satoshi couldn\u2019t use it in 2008.<strong>\u201c</strong></p>\n<p><em>The following is a great example, we came by, for the Zero Knowledge proof: </em></p>\n<p><em>Imagine your friend is color-blind. You have two billiard balls; one is red, one is green, but they are otherwise identical. To your friend they seem completely identical, and he is skeptical that they are actually distinguishable. You want to prove to him that they are in fact differently-colored. On the other hand, you do not want him to learn which is red and which is green.</em></p>\n<p><em>Here is the proof system: You give the two balls to your friend so that he is holding one in each hand. You can see the balls at this point, but you don\u2019t tell him which is which. Your friend then puts both hands behind his back. Next, he either switches the balls between his hands, or leaves them be, with probability 1/2 each. Finally, he brings them out from behind his back. You now have to \u201cguess\u201d whether or not he switched the balls. By looking at their colors, you can, of course, say with certainty whether or not he switched them. On the other hand, if they were the same color and hence indistinguishable, there is no way you could guess correctly with probability higher than 1/2.</em></p>\n<p><em>If you and your friend repeat this \u201cproof\u201d\u00a0 </em> <em>\u00a0times (for large t), your friend should become convinced that the balls are indeed differently colored; otherwise, the probability that you would have succeeded at identifying all the switch/non-switches is at most t^-2</em> <em>. Furthermore, the proof is \u201czero-knowledge\u201d because your friend never learns which ball is green and which is red; indeed, he gains no knowledge about how to distinguish the balls.</em></p>\n<p><em>The same idea works for Zcash. The miner can verify an encrypted transaction without seeing the transaction itself. He repeats some mathematical proof where each time he gains some more certainty that the transaction is indeed valid. After a large number of proofs the probability that the miner will approve an un-valid transaction becomes negligible. </em></p>\n<p><strong>Government recognition of Zcash</strong></p>\n<p><em>Japan as an example:\u00a0</em>\u201cIf you are the financial services authority of Japan, you don\u2019t want Japanese people using a payment system which discloses all of their transaction to North Korea (as in Bitcoin).\u00a0Bitcoin is more dangerous for Japanese people in that way than Zcash is.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Just logon to </em><a href=\"https://blockchain.info/\"><em>Blockchain.info</em></a><em> to see the latest Bitcoin transactions, as seen here for example: everyone can see the sender and receiver addresses, the amount of money transferred and when.</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/p5.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3753\" src=\"https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/p5.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/p5.png 1125w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/p5-300x142.png 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/p5-768x362.png 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/p5-1024x483.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1125px) 100vw, 1125px\"/></a></p>\n<p>\u201cThere are tradeoffs. If the Japanese people use Zcash, you do lose traceability, but it is ok because you don\u2019t have that traceability for cash or even for credit cards\u201d (<em>a third party discloses the transaction information if needed, but it is not open to anyone \u2013 selective transparency</em>). That\u2019s the same thing you can do with Zcash, it also has selective transparency. \u201c</p>\n<p><em>Selective transparency is a feature in the Zcash protocol that gives a user the ability to disclose his transaction history to a certain party. For other parties, all the user\u2019s transaction history is encrypted.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cMost of the bitcoin payment transactions rely on a third party intermediary (like CoinBase, BitStamp, Bitflyer etc.). As long as people rely on a third party intermediary, Zcash acts more like the conventional banking system does from the perspective of regulation. In that model, the encryption in Zcash is not hiding the information from the provider and it\u2019s not hiding the information from the Japanese government. It\u2019s hiding the information from the North Korean government.\u00a0People that don\u2019t use a third party cannot use the banking system, but they can use Bitcoin or Zcash. If you use Bitcoin, your information is disclosed to anyone on the internet.\u00a0With Zcash the information is protected.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Adding private information to a transaction on the Zcash blockchain</strong></p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0</strong>\u201cAnother virtue of Zcash, is that it allows you to put more information into the transaction.</p>\n<p>Because the transaction is only visible to authorized parties, you don\u2019t mind adding to the transaction. For example \u2013 \u2018this is for the shaving brush\u2019, whereas in Bitcoin, you might not want to add further information to it as it is transparent to the world.</p>\n<p>That information will be visible to the government either if you use a third party intermediary or you choose to disclose that information to the government.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, Zcash might be better for the government in some cases because once the user is compliant or uses a third party for his payments, the information is richer. There is a law which Bitcoin companies cannot satisfy and Zcash can. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer\">KYC </a>(know your customer) of the customer has to travel with the payment if you transfer money on behalf of the customer from one financial institution to another.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Nowadays, Bitcoin and Zcash serve mainly as a store of value. Will it ever serve as a currency?</strong></p>\n<p>\u201cThat is my goal; for Zcash and for Bitcoin to serve as a currency. A good strategy for that, is to look for opportunities where the competition is weak. Wherever the competition is worst, that\u2019s where Zcash and Bitcoin can shine. I really want Zcash to take over the USD, but it is going to take a long time, that is a bigger challenge. Currently, I\u2019m really excited about Zcash against the Venezuelan Bolivar, Zcash is obviously way better than it.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>A cup of coffee in eastern Caracas, Venezuela, today costs 460% more bolivar than it cost a year ago (450 to 2,800 Bolivar). As published on the </em><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-venezuela-cafe-con-leche-index/\"><em>Venezuelan cafe con leche index</em></a>.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere are around 250 fiat currencies in the world, the average currency lasts just 100 years.\u00a0You can basically expect one fiat currency to completely fail every few years. Currently it is the Venezuelan Bolivar.</p>\n<p>The great competitor for a failed currency is the USD, one way Zcash and Bitcoin could benefit from that, is to serve as the gateway to USD for these countries.

I wanted to dip my toe in the water of Machine Learning while working on a real-world problem. This seemed like a realistic app to tackle.</p><p name=\"80b3\" id=\"80b3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Before I set out on training my own model, I tried a few strategies that would have made things a lot easier if they had worked.</p><p name=\"99ac\" id=\"99ac\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The first thing I tried was using an optical character recognition library called <a href=\"https://github.com/garnele007/SwiftOCR\" data-href=\"https://github.com/garnele007/SwiftOCR\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SwiftOCR</a>. The problem with using SwiftOCR for my use case was that it is designed for reading strings (like giftcard codes) rather than individual numbers. I also couldn\u2019t get it to differentiate between \u201cthis is an empty square\u201d and \u201cI couldn\u2019t read this digit\u201d. After several hours of experimentation it wasn\u2019t doing much better than randomly guessing digits. That\u2019s not a knock on SwiftOCR. It\u2019s a great library; it\u2019s just not well suited for this particular problem.</p><p name=\"0024\" id=\"0024\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Second, I moved on to <a href=\"https://github.com/ph1ps/MNIST-CoreML\" data-href=\"https://github.com/ph1ps/MNIST-CoreML\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a pre-trained MNIST model</a> that had already been converted to CoreML. MNIST is an open dataset of handwritten digits released in the 1990s. Using a pre-trained model would have been nice because it could have been a drop-in solution. The\u00a0<code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">.mlmodel</code> file is completely self contained and exposes a class in Swift that you can basically use as a black box oracle. Using MNIST was how I reached the milestone of having my first internal prototype that \u201cworked\u201d from start to finish. Unfortunately, the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits is not close enough to computer fonts to generalize well and that first prototype was very finicky and prone to errors.</p><p name=\"be17\" id=\"be17\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">By this point things were working well enough that I knew I was on the right track. I hoped that if I could train my own Machine Learning model on real-world data extracted from Sudoku puzzles that it would become a lot more accurate and reliable.</p><h4 name=\"7ecb\" id=\"7ecb\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">Gathering data</h4><p name=\"8c53\" id=\"8c53\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">The next step was to gather as many examples of Sudoku puzzles as I could. I went to our local <a href=\"https://www.hpb.com/home\" data-href=\"https://www.hpb.com/home\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Half Price Book Store</a> and bought out their entire stock of Sudoku books.</p><p name=\"942d\" id=\"942d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I had the team at <a href=\"http://about.hatchlings.com\" data-href=\"http://about.hatchlings.com\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Hatchlings</a> help me rip them apart and I modified the prototype app to upload each of the small squares it scanned to a server instead of running them through the CoreML model.</p><figure name=\"5003\" id=\"5003\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Our treasure trove of real-world data acquired from the local secondhand book\u00a0store.</figcaption></figure><h4 name=\"52b8\" id=\"52b8\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure\">Many hands make for light\u00a0work</h4><p name=\"541a\" id=\"541a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Now I had a problem. After I scanned a wide variety of puzzles from each book, my server had stored about 600,000 images\u2026 but they were completely unlabeled.</p><figure name=\"7c04\" id=\"7c04\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetLeft graf-after--p\"><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Simple classification tool</figcaption></figure><p name=\"189e\" id=\"189e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">So I cheated a little; I tapped into my secret superpower: thousands of <a href=\"http://about.hatchlings.com\" data-href=\"http://about.hatchlings.com\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Hatchlings</a> users happy to help the developer of their favorite game.</p><p name=\"992f\" id=\"992f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I made a simple admin tool that let users classify images by pressing the number keys on their keyboard. After putting out a call for help in our Hatchlings Facebook Group, our users made quick work of things and within 24 hours they had classified all 600,000 images!</p><figure name=\"4470\" id=\"4470\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetLeft graf-after--p\"><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Admin tool to send mistakes back to the\u00a0pool</figcaption></figure><p name=\"2ed7\" id=\"2ed7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Unfortunately, a small minority had misunderstood the task and there were a significant number of misidentified images.</p><p name=\"3a44\" id=\"3a44\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">To correct this I made a second tool that showed you 100 images (all supposed to be the same number) and asked you to click the ones that didn\u2019t match (which then threw them back into the first tool to be reclassified).</p><p name=\"56ed\" id=\"56ed\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">After the first pass I had enough verified data that I was able to add an automatic accuracy checker into both tools for future data runs (it would periodically show the user known images and check their work to determine how much to trust their answers going forward).</p><p name=\"9ef6\" id=\"9ef6\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Over the next few weeks our players classified several more batches of scanned data. By the time we launched the app it was trained on over a million images of Sudoku squares.</p><p name=\"8c51\" id=\"8c51\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I used this dataset in place of the MNIST dataset and used <a href=\"https://sriraghu.com/2017/07/06/computer-vision-in-ios-coremlkerasmnist/\" data-href=\"https://sriraghu.com/2017/07/06/computer-vision-in-ios-coremlkerasmnist/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a tutorial to help me craft a neural network</a> using Keras. The results turned out better than I expected: 98.6% accuracy! We\u2019ve been able to improve that to above 99% accuracy in subsequent versions.</p><h4 name=\"201c\" id=\"201c\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">Train on real world\u00a0data</h4><p name=\"24a1\" id=\"24a1\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">At this point things were working well on the corpus of Sudoku puzzles we had collected from the bookstore. What we didn\u2019t realize was that this was only a small subset of the Sudoku puzzle layouts out there waiting for us in the wild.</p><p name=\"cd00\" id=\"cd00\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Immediately after launch we started receiving reports that our app wasn\u2019t working with on-screen puzzles. Of course! People wanted to try our app but they didn\u2019t have a Sudoku in front of them so they searched on Google for a puzzle to try it out. This is obvious in retrospect, but it blindsided us on launch day.</p><p name=\"acc7\" id=\"acc7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Problem number one was that our machine learning model was only trained on paper puzzles; it didn\u2019t know what to think about pixels on a screen. I pulled an all nighter that first week and re-trained our model with puzzles on computer screens.</p><p name=\"0211\" id=\"0211\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Problem number two was that ARKit only supports horizontal planes like tables and floors (not vertical planes like computer monitors). Solving this was a trickier problem but I did come up with a hacky workaround. I used a combination of some heuristics and <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">FeaturePoint</code> detection to place puzzles on non-horizontal planes.</p><figure name=\"b617\" id=\"b617\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetLeft graf-after--p\"><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Our ML model is now trained on blurry images as\u00a0well</figcaption></figure><p name=\"9178\" id=\"9178\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Another unexpected issue we discovered after launch was that <a href=\"https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:ufkTnSVvahEJ:https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/78954+&amp;cd=2&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us\" data-href=\"https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:ufkTnSVvahEJ:https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/78954+&amp;cd=2&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ARKit has a fixed (and hard-coded) focal length</a>; it doesn\u2019t autofocus. There is also some variation between devices (things work Ok on my iPhone 7 camera sensor but iPhone 6S has trouble focusing up close). Our \u201cfix\u201d to this was to add blurrycam images to the training set. I wasn\u2019t sure whether it would be able to grok useful info from these images that I couldn\u2019t even read myself... but adding them didn\u2019t seem to affect accuracy of the model much if at all! The current version of the app works well even when the numbers in the image are super blurry.</p><h4 name=\"05f5\" id=\"05f5\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">The cloud</h4><p name=\"61cb\" id=\"61cb\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Finally, I had heard a lot of hype about <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-ai/amis/\" data-href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-ai/amis/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">AWS\u2019s GPU Instances for Deep Learning</a> and <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/products/machine-learning/\" data-href=\"https://cloud.google.com/products/machine-learning/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Google Cloud\u2019s Deep Learning offerings</a> so I tried them out (and also tried the \u201cHeroku for Deep Learning\u201d platform <a href=\"https://www.floydhub.com/\" data-href=\"https://www.floydhub.com/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">FloydHub</a>).</p><p name=\"5b5c\" id=\"5b5c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">They worked. But they were slow. My 2016 Macbook Pro running <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">tensorflow-cpu</code> was outperforming the AWS <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">p2.xlarge</code> GPU instance. My suspicion is that the training runs were being bottlenecked by disk not compute.</p><p name=\"c503\" id=\"c503\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The cloud instances are also expensive. By my calculations, the payoff period of building my own box would be less than 2 months of cloud run-time. So I <a href=\"https://pcpartpicker.com/list/FRmGCy\" data-href=\"https://pcpartpicker.com/list/FRmGCy\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">built a machine with relatively modest specs for about $1200</a> and parked it in my parents\u2019 basement. It\u2019s over 3x faster on my dataset than the AWS GPU instance I was experimenting with and should pay for itself soon.</p><h3 name=\"8c84\" id=\"8c84\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">What\u2019s Next</h3><p name=\"38b5\" id=\"38b5\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">I\u2019m still a Machine Learning beginner but I\u2019ve learned a lot through making Magic Sudoku.</p><p name=\"cb43\" id=\"cb43\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Over the next few weeks I have a pretty long to-do list of bug fixes and minor improvements of the current feature-set. Now that I\u2019ve fixed most of the issues with weird fonts, weights, padding, and blurriness, the next step is to improve my heuristics to better identify puzzles.</p><p name=\"784f\" id=\"784f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The current version (v1.4) can get into trouble if there isn\u2019t much padding between the puzzle and the edge of the sheet of paper or if there is text near the edges. I have some theories on how I can improve this but it will probably be a lot of trial and error to get it right.</p><p name=\"7085\" id=\"7085\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">If I can\u2019t get the heuristics to work I\u2019ve been collecting a dataset of properly aligned puzzles and bad scans that I can use to train another neural network to filter out the bad scans.</p><p name=\"e9e0\" id=\"e9e0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In the longer term we have plans to add some pretty awesome features. For example, we\u2019d like to add a \u201cchecker\u201d feature for completed puzzles. Most of the new features we have planned will require us to read and separate handwriting from computer-given numbers so we\u2019ve been collecting handwriting samples from users around the world to train a new machine learning model.</p><p name=\"e746\" id=\"e746\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">We also need to work out our business model. But that\u2019s a story that will have to wait for part three.</p><h3 name=\"02f3\" id=\"02f3\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Stay tuned\u2026</h3><p name=\"504f\" id=\"504f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">This is the second post in a 3-part series. </em><a href=\"https://blog.prototypr.io/why-we-built-magic-sudoku-the-arkit-sudoku-solver-306dde6c0a77\" data-href=\"https://blog.prototypr.io/why-we-built-magic-sudoku-the-arkit-sudoku-solver-306dde6c0a77\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" target=\"_blank\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Part one</em></a><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\"> explained why we decided to make Magic Sudoku and what makes it unique.

Thus this article is not the determining factor for whether or not Mars is a pipe dream.<p>The other big danger of spaceflight is the body&#x27;s response to microgravity, which can be solved with a massive centrifuge. Hard, but possible.<p>Telling humans to not dream and have hope for colonizing Mars is an egregious offence. The window of technology is open, but it will not be open forever. We will lose our technology in the future, either soon or in many millenia. In addition, there is rising tension in our low-growth society. A few more natural disasters or bad geo-political alliances and tensions might explode, hastening the closing of our technology window. Should that window close, and we fail to reach Mars, then humans will be a grand failure: We had all the resources to colonize another planet and begin colonizing the Universe, but instead we killed ourselves as we gave in to our aggressive tendencies.<p>Thus we _must_ be more ambitious. We _must_ dream big and strive every day to do the impossible, for the cost of not striving may be another 14-billion-year waiting period to get the opportunity to do this again, on another planet, at another time, waiting for another species to awaken with consciousness and begin it&#x27;s own effort to overcome the Great Filter[1].<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Great_Filter\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Great_Filter</a>", "I\u2019m into science, not quasi religious hope in the face of the terror of our own extinction.

This was my fourth trip to space, and by the end of the mission I'd spent 520 days up there, more than any other NASA astronaut.

Find the edge of the bed. Feet down. Sit up. Stand up. At every stage I feel like I'm fighting through quicksand. When I'm finally vertical, the pain in my legs is awful, and on top of that pain I feel a sensation that's even more alarming: it feels as though all the blood in my body is rushing to my legs, like the sensation of the blood rushing to your head when you do a handstand, but in reverse.</p><p data-reactid=\"555\">I can feel the tissue in my legs swelling. I shuffle my way to the bath room, moving my weight from one foot to the other with deliberate effort. Left. Right. Left. Right. I make it to the bathroom, flip on the light, and look down at my legs. They are swollen and alien stumps, not legs at all. \"Oh shit,\" I say. \"Amiko, come look at this.\" She kneels down and squeezes one ankle, and it squishes like a water balloon. She looks up at me with worried eyes. \"I can't even feel your ankle bones,\" she says.</p><p data-reactid=\"557\">\"My skin is burning, too,\" I tell her. Amiko frantically examines me. I have a strange rash all over my back, the backs of my legs, the back of my head and neck \u2013 everywhere I was in contact with the bed. I can feel her cool hands moving over my inflamed skin. \"It looks like an allergic rash,\" she says. \"Like hives.\"</p><p data-reactid=\"559\">I use the bathroom and shuffle back to bed, wondering what I should do. Normally if I woke up feeling like this, I would go to the emergency room. But no one at the hospital will have seen symptoms of having been in space for a year. I crawl back into bed, trying to find a way to lie down without touching my rash.</p><p data-reactid=\"561\">I can hear Amiko rummaging in the medicine cabinet. She returns with two ibuprofen and a glass of water. As she settles down, I can tell from her every movement, every breath, that she is worried about me. We both knew the risks of the mission I signed on for. After six years together, I can understand her perfectly, even in the wordless dark.</p><p data-reactid=\"563\">As I try to will myself to sleep, I wonder whether my friend Misha, by now back in Moscow, is also suffering from swollen legs and painful rashes. I suspect so. This is why we volunteered for this mission, after all: to discover more about how the human body is affected by long-term space flight. Scientists will study the data on Misha and my 53-year-old self for the rest of our lives and beyond. Our space agencies won't be able to push out farther into space, to a destination like Mars, until we can learn more about how to strengthen the weakest links in the chain that make space flight possible: the human body and mind.</p><p data-reactid=\"565\">People often ask me why I volunteered for this mission, knowing the risks: the risk of launch, the risk inherent in space walks, the risk of returning to Earth, the risks I would be exposed to every moment I lived in a metal container orbiting the Earth at 28,100 kilometres an hour. I have a few answers I give to this question, but none of them feels fully satisfying to me. None of them quite answers it.</p><div data-reactid=\"567\"><figure class=\"_3ujPS _3g3zI\" data-reactid=\"568\"><a href=\"\" data-reactid=\"569\"><picture data-reactid=\"570\"><source media=\"(min-width: 1024px)\" srcset=\"https://static.ffx.io/images/$width_780,$height_439/t_crop_fill/t_quality_best,f_auto/574254561d25e642679f244026b8ede85aa2c487\" data-reactid=\"571\"/><source media=\"(min-width: 768px)\" srcset=\"https://static.ffx.io/images/$width_960,$height_540/t_crop_fill/t_quality_best,f_auto/574254561d25e642679f244026b8ede85aa2c487\" data-reactid=\"572\"/><img alt=\"Scott Kelly (at left) undertaking a dangerous space walk outside the International Space Station.\" srcset=\"https://static.ffx.io/images/$width_768,$height_432/t_crop_fill/t_quality_best,f_auto/574254561d25e642679f244026b8ede85aa2c487\" data-reactid=\"573\"/></picture></a><figcaption class=\"_3CZmy\" data-reactid=\"574\"><p data-reactid=\"575\">Scott Kelly (at left) undertaking a dangerous space walk outside the International Space Station.</p><cite data-reactid=\"576\">Photo: Courtesy of Penguin Random House Australia</cite></figcaption></figure></div><p data-reactid=\"580\"><strong data-reactid=\"581\">A normal mission to the International Space Station</strong> lasts five to six months, so scientists have a good deal of data about what happens to the human body in space for that length of time. But very little is known about what occurs after month six. The symptoms may get precipitously worse in the ninth month, for instance, or they may level off. We don't know, and there is only one way to find out.</p><p data-reactid=\"584\">During our mission, Misha and I collected various types of data for studies on our selves, which took a significant amount of our time. Because Mark and I were identical twins, I also took part in an extensive study comparing the two of us throughout the year, down to the genetic level. The ISS was a world-class orbiting laboratory, and in addition to the human studies of which I was one of the main subjects, I also spent a lot of my time during the year working on other experiments, like fluid physics, botany, combustion and Earth observation.</p><p data-reactid=\"586\">When I talked about the ISS to audiences, I always shared with them the importance of the science being done there. But to me, it was just as important that the station was serving as a foothold for our species in space. From here, we could learn more about how to push out further into the cosmos. The costs were high, as were the risks.</p><p data-reactid=\"588\">On my previous flight to the space station, a mission of 159 days, I lost bone mass, my muscles atrophied, and my blood redistributed itself in my body, which strained and shrank the walls of my heart. More troubling, I experienced problems with my vision, as many other astronauts had. I had been exposed to more than 30 times the radiation of a person on Earth, equivalent to about 10 chest X-rays every day. This exposure would increase my risk of a fatal cancer for the rest of my life.</p><p data-reactid=\"590\">None of this compared, though, to the most troubling risk: that something bad could happen to someone I love while I was in space with no way for me to come home.</p><p data-reactid=\"592\"><strong data-reactid=\"593\">I had been on the station for a week</strong>, and was getting better at knowing where I was when I first woke up. If I had a headache, I knew it was because I had drifted too far from the vent blowing clean air at my face. I was often still disoriented about how my body was positioned: I would wake up convinced that I was upside down, because in the dark and without gravity, my inner ear took a random guess as to how my body was positioned in the small space. When I turned on a light, I had a sort of visual illusion that the room was rotating rapidly as it reoriented itself around me, though I knew it was actually my brain readjusting in response to new sensory input.</p><p data-reactid=\"596\">The light in my crew quarters took a minute to warm up to full brightness. The space was just barely big enough for me and my sleeping bag, two laptops, some clothes, toiletries, photos of Amiko and my daughters, a few paperback books. I looked at my schedule for today. I clicked through new emails, stretched and yawned, then fished around in my toiletries bag, attached to the wall down by my left knee, for my toothpaste and toothbrush. I brushed, still in my sleeping bag, then swallowed the toothpaste and chased it with a sip of water out of a bag with a straw. There wasn't really a good way to spit in space.</p><p data-reactid=\"598\"><strong data-reactid=\"599\">I didn't get to spend time outside the station</strong> until my first of two planned space walks, which was almost seven months in. This was one of the things that some people found difficult to imagine about living on the space station, the fact that I couldn't step outside when I felt like it. Putting on a spacesuit and leaving the station for a space walk was an hours-long process that required the full attention of at least three people on station and dozens more on the ground.</p><p data-reactid=\"602\">Space walks were the most dangerous thing we did in orbit. Even if the station was on fire, even if it was filling up with poison gas, even if a meteoroid had crashed through a module and outer space was rushing in, the only way to escape the station was in a Soyuz capsule, which also needed preparation and planning to depart safely. We practised dealing with emergency scenarios regularly, and in many of these drills we raced to prepare the Soyuz as quickly as we could. No one had ever had to use the Soyuz as a lifeboat, and no one hoped to.</p><p data-reactid=\"604\"><strong data-reactid=\"605\">I opened a food container</strong> attached to the wall and fished out a pouch of dehydrated coffee with cream and sugar. I floated over to the hot-water dispenser in the ceiling of the lab, which worked by insert ing a needle into a nozzle on the bag. When the bag was full, I replaced the needle with a drinking straw \u2013 this way the liquid didn't escape into the module. It had been oddly unsatisfying at first to drink coffee from a plastic bag sipped through a straw, but now I wasn't bothered by it.</p><p data-reactid=\"608\">I flipped through the breakfast options, looking for a packet of the granola I liked. Unfortunately, everyone else seemed to like it, too. I chose some dehydrated eggs instead and reconstituted them with the same hot water dispenser, then warmed up some irradiated sausage links in the food warmer box, which looked a lot like a metal briefcase. I cut the bag open, then, since we had no sink, cleaned the scissors by licking them (we each had our own scissors). I spooned the eggs out of the bag onto a tortilla \u2013 conveniently, surface tension held them in place \u2013 added the sausage and some hot sauce, rolled it up, and ate the burrito while catch ing up with the morning's news on <em data-reactid=\"610\">CNN</em>.</p><p data-reactid=\"613\">All the while I was holding myself in place with my right big toe tucked ever so slightly under a handrail on the floor. Handrails were placed on the walls, floors and ceilings of every module and at the hatches where modules connected, allowing us to propel ourselves through the modules or to stay in place rather than drifting away. There were a lot of things about living in weightlessness that were fun, but eating was not one of them. I missed being able to sit in a chair while eating a meal, relaxing and pausing to connect with other people.</p><div data-reactid=\"615\"><figure class=\"_3ujPS _3g3zI\" data-reactid=\"616\"><a href=\"\" data-reactid=\"617\"><picture data-reactid=\"618\"><source media=\"(min-width: 1024px)\" srcset=\"https://static.ffx.io/images/$width_780,$height_439/t_crop_fill/t_quality_best,f_auto/20260c0bec151874ede9935989e3e48e93fe7229\" data-reactid=\"619\"/><source media=\"(min-width: 768px)\" srcset=\"https://static.ffx.io/images/$width_960,$height_540/t_crop_fill/t_quality_best,f_auto/20260c0bec151874ede9935989e3e48e93fe7229\" data-reactid=\"620\"/><img alt=\"&quot;I missed being able to sit in a chair while eating a meal, relaxing and pausing to connect with other people,&quot; writes Kelly of life on the ISS. \" srcset=\"https://static.ffx.io/images/$width_768,$height_432/t_crop_fill/t_quality_best,f_auto/20260c0bec151874ede9935989e3e48e93fe7229\" data-reactid=\"621\"/></picture></a><figcaption class=\"_3CZmy\" data-reactid=\"622\"><p data-reactid=\"623\">\"I missed being able to sit in a chair while eating a meal, relaxing and pausing to connect with other people,\" writes Kelly of life on the ISS. </p><cite data-reactid=\"624\">Photo: Marco Grob</cite></figcaption></figure></div><p data-reactid=\"628\"><strong data-reactid=\"629\">More than 400 experiments </strong>took place on ISS during this expedition. NASA scientists talked about the research falling into two major categories. The first had to do with studies that might benefit life on Earth. These included research on the properties of chemicals that could be used in new drugs, combustion studies that were unlocking new ways to get more efficiency out of the fuel we burnt, and the development of new materials. The second large category had to do with solving problems for future space exploration: testing new life-support equipment, solving technical problems of spaceflight and studying new ways of handling the demands of the human body in space.</p><p data-reactid=\"632\">Science took up about a third of my time, human studies about three-quarters of that. I had to take blood samples from myself and my crew mates for analysis back on Earth, and I kept a log of everything, from what I ate to my moods. I tested my reaction skills at various points throughout the day. I took ultrasounds of blood vessels, my heart, my eyes and my muscles. I also took part in an experiment called Fluid Shifts, using a device that sucked the blood down to the lower half of my body, where gravity normally kept it. This tested a leading theory about why space flight caused damage to some astronauts' vision.</p><p data-reactid=\"634\">In fact, there was much crossover between these categories of research. If we could learn how to counteract the devastating impact of bone loss in microgravity, the solutions could well be applied to osteoporosis and other bone diseases. If we could learn how to keep our hearts healthy in space, that knowledge could be useful on Earth. </p><p data-reactid=\"636\">The effects of living in space looked a lot like the effects of ageing, which affected us all. The lettuce we grew was a study for future space travel \u2013 astronauts on their way to Mars will have no fresh food but what they can grow \u2013 but it also taught us more about growing food efficiently on Earth. The ISS's closed water system, where we processed our urine into clean water, will be crucial for getting to Mars, but it also has promising implications for treating water on Earth \u2013 especially in places where clean water was scarce.</p><p data-reactid=\"638\"><strong data-reactid=\"639\">I tell my flight surgeon, Steve,</strong> that I feel well enough to get right to work immediately upon returning from space, and I do, but within a few days I feel much worse. This is what it means to have allowed my body to be used for science. I will be a test subject for the rest of my life. A few months after arriving back on Earth, though, I feel distinctly better. I've been travelling the country and the world talking about my experiences in space. It's gratifying to see how curious people are about my mission, how much children instinctively feel the excitement and wonder of space flight, and how many people think, as I do, that Mars is the next step.</p><p data-reactid=\"642\">I also know that if we want to go to Mars, it will be very, very difficult, it will cost a great deal of money and it may likely cost human lives. But I know now that if we decide to do it, we can. </p><p data-reactid=\"644\"><strong data-reactid=\"645\">Edited extract from <em data-reactid=\"647\">Endurance: A Year in Space, A Lifetime of Discovery</em> by Scott Kelly (Doubleday, $35), published on October 19.</strong></p></div></div></body></html>"}, "15430678": {"score": 3, "comments": [], "time": "2017-10-09 02:54:03", "url": "http://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/amazon-is-on-the-brink-of-deciding-if-it-will-make-a-big-move-into-selling-drugs-online/ar-AAsZXbj", "text": "<html><body><div><div class=\"richtext\" data-aop=\"articlebody\">\n <div class=\"xnetvidplayer\" data-aop=\"xnet-mod\" aria-label=\"Video 'Amazon's health ambitions' \" tabindex=\"0\"><button class=\"overlay-open\"><span>Click to expand</span></button><button class=\"overlay-close\"/><div class=\"nextvideo-outer\"><div class=\"nextvideo-inner\"><img alt=\"UP NEXT\" class=\"vid-image\"/><p class=\"coming-up\">&#13;\n UP NEXT&#13;\n</p><p class=\"vid-title\"/><p class=\"circle\"/><p class=\"next-seconds\"/><button class=\"cancel\"/></div></div></div><p><a href=\"https://pub.cnbc.com/id/1502862?__source=msn|money|inline|story|&amp;par=msn&amp;doc=104757634\"><strong>Amazon</strong></a> is in the final stages of figuring out its strategy to get into the multibillion dollar prescription drug market.\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>The company will decide before Thanksgiving whether to move into selling prescription drugs online, according to an email from Amazon viewed by CNBC and a source familiar with the situation.

This noise is everywhere and unavoidable, arising from microscopic oscillations of atoms and electrons in all matter. So we have to invent new ways of dealing with quantum errors.</p>\n<p>When you make a phone call in a congested network, or scratch a CD, the technology can still work: conversations remain comprehensible and music still plays.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/hype-and-cash-are-muddying-public-understanding-of-quantum-computing-82647\">Hype and cash are muddying public understanding of quantum computing</a></em></p>\n<p>This is because these devices use <a href=\"https://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Error-correcting_code\">error correcting codes</a>: even if errors corrupt the raw data stream, the important logical information can still be reconstructed. And these can be adapted for quantum computing.</p>\n<h2>A time you can count on</h2>\n<p>To see how this works for classical coding, consider the solution used by early navigators.</p>\n<p>They knew that longitude could be calculated from the elevation of the Sun so long as the time at home port was known \u2014 hence the naval imperative to build accurate, stable clocks.</p>\n<p>Ideally, one clock would be sufficient, but what if something went wrong? Two clocks are better, so long as they both agree. But if they disagree, which is right? With three clocks, a majority vote allows the timekeeper to detect and reset a wayward timepiece.</p>\n<p>For binary data, represented by 0s and 1s, repetition protects information: a logical bit \u201c0\u201d is represented in three physical bits as 000, while \u201c1\u201d is represented as 111.</p>\n<p>Suppose during data transmission of \u201c0\u201d, the last physical bit was accidentally flipped, so that the received message is 001. The recipient would immediately see that an error had corrupted the data.</p>\n<p>Further, by taking a majority vote, she would guess that an error affected the third physical bit, and correctly decode the logical bit: \u201c0\u201d. As long as errors are rare, the repetition code will allow logical data to be transmitted reliably over a noisy, error-prone channel.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Error detection and error correction if the data is sent in threes. The Conversation, <a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/\">CC BY-ND</a></p>\n<h2>Known unknowns</h2>\n<p>One quantum wrinkle in this picture is that it involves a \u201cmeasurement\u201d. The receiver knows exactly what physical bits she received (001 in the example, above), which implies that she had to measure them (that is, look at them).</p>\n<p>But <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-issues/#MeasProb\">quantum mechanics</a> tells us that the act of measurement fundamentally changes the state of a quantum system. Simply measuring quantum bits (qubits) changes the message.</p>\n<p>So a quantum receiver isn\u2019t allowed to measure the qubits directly, but she still needs to figure out whether errors have occurred, and where.</p>\n<p>To resolve this we return to the repetition code for guidance. Instead of looking at the bit values, the receiver could instead ask the following two questions:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Q1: is the first bit the same as the second bit?</p>\n<p>Q2: is the second bit the same as the third bit?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If there were no errors, the answer to both of these questions would be \u201cyes\u201d, regardless of whether the message was 000 or 111.</p>\n<p>But if the last bit suffered an error (receiving 001 or 110), the answer to Q1 would be \u201cyes\u201d but Q2 would be \u201cno\u201d. From this response, the recipient can infer the existence of an error and its location.</p>\n<p>Similarly, an error on the first bit will be revealed by the pattern Q1=\u201cNo\u201d, Q2=\u201cYes\u201d. An error on the middle bit will be revealed by Q1=Q2=\u201cNo\u201d. Thus, any single error will be uniquely determined by these answers, and can be repaired.</p>\n<p>Knowing which physical bit suffered an error, she would fix it by deliberately flipping that bit, to reverse the effect of the original error. This can happen without knowing the state of the damaged bit.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Error detection and correction at the quantum computer scale. The Conversation, <a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/\">CC BY-ND</a></p>\n<p>Notice that answering these questions only requires comparative knowledge of the received bits. It does not depend on their particular value, nor the encoded logical information.</p>\n<p>This principle captures the essence of quantum error correcting codes. It allows us to simultaneously identify errors and avoid damaging quantum information.</p>\n<p>Rather than measuring the value of individual physical qubits, a series of comparative questions are asked: \u201cAre the qubits in group A the same as each other?\u201d, \u201cAre the qubits in group B the same as each other?\u201d and so on. The answers to these questions yield clues as to the whereabouts of errors, but without revealing the message itself.</p>\n<p>These answers are then used to infer and correct the likely errors.</p>\n<p>The logical quantum information is encoded in yet another combination of qubits, which we measure only when we really do want to discover the logical quantum state.</p>\n<p>This approach is active, and computationally expensive for large data sets. For some applications, it is necessary. But if engineers in the 1940s had faced a similar struggle to develop early computers, I suspect that the laptop I\u2019m writing this on would never have been built.</p>\n<h2>Magnetic stability</h2>\n<p>Instead, they were lucky, as nature itself does classical error correction for free. Magnets are incredibly stable, so they are used to store vast amounts of information in hard disks with almost no active error correction.</p>\n<p>Magnets are just collections of many magnetic atoms that tend to align their magnetic axes with one another, so they all point \u201cnorth\u201d.</p>\n<p>If a cosmic ray spontaneously kicks the magnetic orientation of one atom, its atomic neighbours exert a magnetic force that realigns it with the majority direction. So a magnet can be thought of as a piece of matter that passively error corrects itself, by a local majority vote.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for quantum computers, we know of no such passively stable state of quantum matter. In fact, we have <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1011.3529.pdf\">mathematical proofs</a> that such matter cannot exist in a two-dimensional universe, while it can in a four-dimensional universe.</p>\n<p>So far, we don\u2019t know whether passively stable quantum matter exists in our own three-dimensional universe.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/all-you-need-for-quantum-computing-at-room-temperature-is-some-mothballs-62549\">All you need for quantum computing at room temperature is some mothballs</a></em></p>\n<p>We do know that with enough skill and resources, we can actively correct quantum errors.</p>\n<p>But to build a quantum memory is an ongoing challenge. There is nothing like a \u201cquantum magnet\u201d to easily store quantum information for us. We have to design and build such a system from the ground up, almost literally atom by atom.</p>\n<p>One of the first major tasks a quantum computer will do is to perform quantum error correction on itself.

And 'why is it in alpha?' This blog post will answer those questions.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Increased automation</strong></p>\n\n<p>We have noticed the steady growth of agile development\u00a0using\u00a0<em>continuous integration</em>\u00a0and\u00a0<em>delivery</em>. You probably have too. Well, one of the chief characteristics of this relatively new approach to software development is increased automation. This puts incredible power in the hands of the developer, allowing entire system architectures to be defined in code and tied to tooling which will automate both testing\u00a0<em>and</em>\u00a0deployment. There's a lot going for this approach, you can see why it's catching on so fast.</p>\n\n<p>But (there is always a 'but') with this power comes a new set of risks and security considerations. It's these which our guidance addresses.\u00a0<a href=\"/blog-post/developers-need-help-too\" rel=\"nofollow\">We've tried to ensure that every recommendation is possible</a>. And though there might be some pain were you to adopt our advice wholesale, now is the time to make the effort - before insecure practices have had time to take root culturally.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Audience</strong></p>\n\n<p>The primary audience for this guidance is development teams practicing\u00a0<em>continuous integration and deployment</em>, an approach which is more common for the development of digital services. Despite this, we hope the advice we give will be of use to\u00a0<em>everyone involved</em>\u00a0in software development and procurement,\u00a0whatever\u00a0your style of development.</p>\n\n<p>That's quite ambitious - 'everyone.' But the guidance itself is high\u00a0level:\u00a0there is no\u00a0language-specific\u00a0advice. It's human readable. Our goal is to help secure the entire process of software development, so we've looked at everything from establishing a security-friendly culture, through to implementation and ongoing management. This work is complementary to our existing\u00a0<a href=\"/guidance/security-design-principles-digital-services-main\" rel=\"nofollow\">design guidance</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Github first</strong></p>\n\n<p>We are publishing this guidance as alpha, acknowledging that we are dealing with a new and rapidly evolving field -\u00a0one\u00a0in which there are still questions to be settled about best practice. We\u00a0welcome your feedback to help us refine our advice, before moving it to 'beta' and 'live' versions.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>And, due to the nature of the guidance, it seemed appropriate to\u00a0<a href=\"https://github.com/ukncsc/secure-development-and-deployment/\" rel=\"nofollow\">share this with you on Github</a>\u00a0first.\u00a0We welcome your feedback through comments and pull requests.

The bangles are luxurious,\u00a0while the leather straps give the bracelet a more relaxed look.\u00a0The design is attractive yet simple enough to go with any kind of outfit, but I wouldn't say the overall look warrants the $195 price tag.</p>\n      <div class=\"gallery shortcode-gallery\">\n      <ul>\n                  <li data-thumb=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ela2-150x150.jpg\" data-src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ela2.jpg\" data-responsive=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ela2-980x653.jpg 1080, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ela2-1440x960.jpg 2560\" data-sub-html=\"#caption-1145393\">\n            <figure>\n              <p class=\"image\"/>\n                              <figcaption id=\"caption-1145393\">\n                  <span class=\"icon caption-arrow icon-drop-indicator\"/>\n                                      <p class=\"caption\">\n                      The Ela bracelet with a leather wrap strap.                    </p>\n                                                        <p class=\"credit\">\n                      <span class=\"icon icon-camera\"/>\n                                              Valentina Palladino                                          </p>\n                                  </figcaption>\n                          </figure>\n          </li>\n                  <li data-thumb=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ela3-150x150.jpg\" data-src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ela3.jpg\" data-responsive=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ela3-980x653.jpg 1080, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ela3-1440x960.jpg 2560\" data-sub-html=\"#caption-1145395\">\n            <figure>\n              <p class=\"image\"/>\n                              <figcaption id=\"caption-1145395\">\n                  <span class=\"icon caption-arrow icon-drop-indicator\"/>\n                                      <p class=\"caption\">\n                      Underside of the module has the charging nodes.                    </p>\n                                                        <p class=\"credit\">\n                      <span class=\"icon icon-camera\"/>\n                                              Valentina Palladino                                          </p>\n                                  </figcaption>\n                          </figure>\n          </li>\n                  <li data-thumb=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ela4-150x150.jpg\" data-src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ela4.jpg\" data-responsive=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ela4-980x653.jpg 1080, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ela4-1440x960.jpg 2560\" data-sub-html=\"#caption-1145397\">\n            <figure>\n              <p class=\"image\"/>\n                              <figcaption id=\"caption-1145397\">\n                  <span class=\"icon caption-arrow icon-drop-indicator\"/>\n                                      <p class=\"caption\">\n                      Marblized quartz stone glows with the light of an LED underneath it when you get smartphone alerts.                    </p>\n                                                        <p class=\"credit\">\n                      <span class=\"icon icon-camera\"/>\n                                              Valentina Palladino                                          </p>\n                                  </figcaption>\n                          </figure>\n          </li>\n                  <li data-thumb=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ela1-150x150.jpg\" data-src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ela1.jpg\" data-responsive=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ela1-980x653.jpg 1080, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ela1-1440x960.jpg 2560\" data-sub-html=\"#caption-1145391\">\n            <figure>\n              <p class=\"image\"/>\n                              <figcaption id=\"caption-1145391\">\n                  <span class=\"icon caption-arrow icon-drop-indicator\"/>\n                                      <p class=\"caption\">\n                      Ela bracelets start around $200.                    </p>\n                                                        <p class=\"credit\">\n                      <span class=\"icon icon-camera\"/>\n                                              Valentina Palladino                                          </p>\n                                  </figcaption>\n                          </figure>\n          </li>\n              </ul>\n    </div>\n  \n\n<p>The Ela bracelet tracks steps throughout the day, but it doesn't do so by default. You need to turn the feature on in the Ela app, and it warns that doing so will decrease the device's battery life. Ela recommends charging the bracelet every night when you go to bed, which makes sense since most people\u00a0don't wear jewelry when they sleep. But the company only promises two to three days of battery life for the bracelet when step tracking is disabled. When turned on, you will certainly need to charge the battery every night.</p>\n<p>Compared to today's technology, that's kind of crazy\u2014<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/08/fitbits-charge-2-and-flex-2-are-next-gen-trackers-that-blend-fitness-and-style/\">Fitbit's $99\u00a0Flex 2</a>\u2014which you can style with accessories to be arguably just as pleasant as an Ela bracelet\u2014tracks steps\u2014has color-coded LED notifications and gets five days of battery life without breaking a sweat. Battery life may be less important for a device like Ela because you don't wear it to bed, while the Flex 2 needs that extra juice to track movement and sleep over five days. Regardless, a device like Ela that does relatively little compared to a device like the Flex 2 shouldn't need to be charged every night.</p>\n<h3>Data and Memories</h3>\n<aside class=\"pullbox sidebar story-sidebar right\"/>\n<p>Arguably the most idiosyncratic feature of any Ela device is Memories, which lets you save photos and audio clips to the device that can only be seen by you and the device's wearer (or only you, if those people are one in the same). The concept makes the most sense when giving an Ela bracelet as a gift. Imagine you purchased the bracelet for your significant other for their birthday. Before gifting it, you can connect the device to your smartphone and, using the Ela mobile app, save content to the device that your significant other will see immediately when they pair\u00a0their new bracelet to their own smartphone.</p>\n<p>Ela jewelry doesn't have a screen, speakers, or onboard storage, so saving content to it really just associates the content to that device and stores it in the cloud. Those photos and clips\u00a0live in the Ela app, so you'll need to revisit the app whenever you want to see those memories, and you can only save about 100MB work of data as Memories. Jewelry, smart or not, can often evoke memories, so this is a modern way of making those memories more accessible.</p>\n<p>However, the accessibility of this content makes it feel a little less personal. Anyone could open up the Ela app on your phone and immediately see those special photos and clips. On the flip side, now many of us look back, deep into our smartphone's photo albums, to relive past memories via photos, videos, gifs, and more.</p>\n      <div class=\"gallery shortcode-gallery\">\n      <ul>\n                  <li data-thumb=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/elaapp1-150x150.jpg\" data-src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/elaapp1.jpg\" data-responsive=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/elaapp1-980x855.jpg 1080, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/elaapp1-1440x1257.jpg 2560\" data-sub-html=\"#caption-1179131\">\n            <figure>\n              <p class=\"image\"/>\n                              <figcaption id=\"caption-1179131\">\n                  <span class=\"icon caption-arrow icon-drop-indicator\"/>\n                                      <p class=\"caption\">\n                      Ela's Memory feature.                    </p>\n                                                    </figcaption>\n                          </figure>\n          </li>\n                  <li data-thumb=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/elaapp2-150x150.jpg\" data-src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/elaapp2.jpg\" data-responsive=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/elaapp2-980x855.jpg 1080, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/elaapp2-1440x1257.jpg 2560\" data-sub-html=\"#caption-1179133\">\n            <figure>\n              <p class=\"image\"/>\n                              <figcaption id=\"caption-1179133\">\n                  <span class=\"icon caption-arrow icon-drop-indicator\"/>\n                                      <p class=\"caption\">\n                      Light designations for contacts.                    </p>\n                                                    </figcaption>\n                          </figure>\n          </li>\n                  <li data-thumb=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/elaapp3-150x150.jpg\" data-src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/elaapp3.jpg\" data-responsive=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/elaapp3-980x855.jpg 1080, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/elaapp3-1440x1257.jpg 2560\" data-sub-html=\"#caption-1179135\">\n            <figure>\n              <p class=\"image\"/>\n                              <figcaption id=\"caption-1179135\">\n                  <span class=\"icon caption-arrow icon-drop-indicator\"/>\n                                      <p class=\"caption\">\n                      Step tracking is lackluster.                    </p>\n                                                    </figcaption>\n                          </figure>\n          </li>\n              </ul>\n    </div>\n  \n\n<p>Maybe I put too much emphasis on the sacredness of memories between two individuals, but I'd rather be given physical photographs or special objects instead of a piece of jewelry attached to an app that holds a few digital images. Those who grew up reliving memories through a screen and the Internet may not feel the same way. Personally, the novelty of Memories would wear off for me after a few weeks.\u00a0Also, there's no real use for Memories if you buy an Ela bracelet for yourself. Sure, you can populate it regularly with your favorite photos and audio clips, but you probably already do that in other apps like Facebook, Instagram, and Spotify.</p>\n<p>I feel safe predicting that Ela's LED-and-vibrating contact notifications will be more useful than Memories in the long-term. It may seem like a lot to remember if you assign all eight colors to different contacts, but that many color-coded contacts is not unheard of. Companies like Fossil Group use color-coded lights or windows on watches and bracelets to show incoming calls and texts from important contacts. I only program three to four colors on any of these devices, so I never have a hard time remembering that\u00a0a text from my mom will make the bracelet glow blue while a call from my boyfriend will produce a pink light.</p>\n<h2>Bellabeat</h2>\n<h3>Design</h3>\n<p>Bellabeat's <a href=\"https://webshop.bellabeat.com/\">Leaf activity tracker</a> will likely appeal to nature-lovers at first glance. The device's design mimics a minimalist plant\u00a0with a metal leaf-shaped case surrounding the activity tracking module. You can get the Leaf Nature with a module made from natural wood that's splash-proof, or you can get the Leaf Urban with a module made of a wood-composite with the appearance and texture of stone. I tested the Leaf Urban, and it's a bit more resistant to water than its Nature counterpart because it's not made entirely out of wood.</p>\n      <div class=\"gallery shortcode-gallery\">\n

</div>\n  \n\n<p>Weighing 0.59 ounces and measuring\u00a01.8\u00a0x 1.1 x 0.43 inches, the Leaf is small enough to fit on a necklace or bracelet. However, it might be too big to comfortably wear on certain clothing\u2014the metal case construction lets you clip the Leaf to your clothing (the company shows it worn as a decorative brooch on your collar). But it seems slightly heavy for flimsy or flowy fabrics like rayon.</p>\n<p>After wearing the Leaf as a bracelet for a few days, I promptly switched it to its necklace chain because I couldn't stand the included double-wrap wristband. It's difficult to secure mainly because\u00a0the\u00a0two hooks that attach to the Leaf's metal case aren't malleable, so the Leaf module easily falls out of one or both of them because of the size of the hooks' openings. You also have to wrap the band around your wrist twice, which not only takes more time, but it also gives the Leaf module more time and opportunity to fall out of the secure hooks. The bracelet combination looks nice when you finally get it on your wrist, but it's not worth the hassle when you also get a necklace with the device.</p>\n<h3>Data and the Bellabeat app</h3>\n<p>The only reason I'd recommend wearing the Leaf on your wrist is for sleep tracking, which it does automatically.\u00a0Wearing a necklace to bed seems like a recipe for entanglement, but to each their\u00a0own. The Leaf's sleep tracking has pros and cons\u2014it automatically enters sleep mode\u00a0(there are no buttons on the device, so it has to do that), but it's not that great at estimating exactly when you fell asleep. After the first night I slept with the device, I synced data to the Leaf smartphone app and the device thought I fell asleep two hours after I actually did. Thankfully, an in-app pop-up lets you immediately edit sleep and wake-up times.\u00a0The Leaf did get better over time, mostly with more accurate wake-up times as it never totally got my fall-sleep time correct.</p>\n<p>Aside from sleep, the Leaf tracks activity, stress, mediation, and menstrual cycles for women. Activity stats are generic but still accurate as far as step counts go. I wish the Leaf could identify periods of intense activity like workouts, but it doesn't, and you'll have to input those yourself. The menu of activities you can log\u00a0is vast, which is a great perk, and a small star over your activity bar graph indicates when during the day you met your move goal. Along with a daily activity graph, the app also shows you daily and weekly averages of active time, steps, and distance, as well as calories burned through activity and resting.</p>\n<p>I'm not the best at meditating regularly (I'm trying to get better), but I was pleasantly surprised by the ease of the meditation program in the Leaf app. After you set goals for how often or long you meditate, you can choose from a number of pre-made programs in the app. Categories include \"feeling grounded\" and \"de-stress,\" among others, and have at least four or five guided meditation programs to complete. In total, there are about 25 meditation options to choose from if you want the Leaf app to guide you, otherwise you can log meditation minutes manually.</p>\n<aside class=\"pullbox sidebar story-sidebar right\"/>\n<p>Each meditation session has a long and short version. I typically completed the four-minute short versions, but there are eight- or 10-minute versions as well. Each has a soothing voice guiding you through a fanciful scenario meant to relax you, while instructing you to breathe deeply, close your eyes, and other small body movements. There are sound effects involved (one \"back pain\" session I did featured the sounds of a babbling brook, chirping birds, and peaceful winds), but not much music because you're meant to focus on your own thoughts, breathing patterns, and the instructions of the app's voice coach.</p>\n<p>The Leaf's guided meditation sessions proved to me that the hardest part of meditation is setting aside time and doing it. I enjoyed the few four-minute sessions I completed, and I felt relaxed after each one. Most wearable companies are incorporating guided breathing exercises into their wristbands, but they typically involve on-screen animation and no sounds or voice coach. Using a mobile app that provides soothing sound effects and a helpful voice, on the other hand, immerses you in the mediation world better than a silent, blinking screen can.</p>\n<p>Leaf also estimates your \"stress level\" as well as giving you a way to manage that stress via guided meditation. This is the most peculiar piece of data in the Leaf app because the program estimates both your level of stress and how prone your body may be to getting stressed out. Leaf uses\u00a0every piece of information at its disposal\u00a0to predict stress\u00a0habits, including how much sleep you got, when you went to bed, how active you've been, how much (or how little) you've meditated, and more. Stress level is represented by a colored geometric shape with four points that lean toward different health aspects that affect stress: steps, sleep, menstrual cycle, and meditation. A red shape indicates high-stress sensitivity while an orange shape indicates a moderate stress sensitivity. A green shape shows you have \"everything under control,\" presumably because every\u00a0trackable health aspect is balanced.</p>\n      <div class=\"gallery shortcode-gallery\">\n      <ul>\n                  <li data-thumb=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/leafapp1-150x150.jpg\" data-src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/leafapp1.jpg\" data-responsive=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/leafapp1-980x855.jpg 1080, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/leafapp1-1440x1257.jpg 2560\" data-sub-html=\"#caption-1179137\">\n            <figure>\n              <p class=\"image\"/>\n                              <figcaption id=\"caption-1179137\">\n                  <span class=\"icon caption-arrow icon-drop-indicator\"/>\n                                      <p class=\"caption\">\n                      Bellabeat Leaf app homepage and activity page.                    </p>\n                                                    </figcaption>\n                          </figure>\n          </li>\n                  <li data-thumb=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/leafapp2-150x150.jpg\" data-src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/leafapp2.jpg\" data-responsive=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/leafapp2-980x855.jpg 1080, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/leafapp2-1440x1257.jpg 2560\" data-sub-html=\"#caption-1179139\">\n            <figure>\n              <p class=\"image\"/>\n                              <figcaption id=\"caption-1179139\">\n                  <span class=\"icon caption-arrow icon-drop-indicator\"/>\n                                      <p class=\"caption\">\n                      Add an activity to your daily log.                    </p>\n                                                    </figcaption>\n                          </figure>\n          </li>\n                  <li data-thumb=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/leafapp3-150x150.jpg\" data-src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/leafapp3.jpg\" data-responsive=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/leafapp3-980x855.jpg 1080, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/leafapp3-1440x1257.jpg 2560\" data-sub-html=\"#caption-1179141\">\n            <figure>\n              <p class=\"image\"/>\n                              <figcaption id=\"caption-1179141\">\n                  <span class=\"icon caption-arrow icon-drop-indicator\"/>\n                                      <p class=\"caption\">\n                      Sleep and stress tracking pages.                    </p>\n                                                    </figcaption>\n                          </figure>\n          </li>\n                  <li data-thumb=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/leafapp4-150x150.jpg\" data-src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/leafapp4.jpg\" data-responsive=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/leafapp4-980x855.jpg 1080, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/leafapp4-1440x1257.jpg 2560\" data-sub-html=\"#caption-1179143\">\n            <figure>\n              <p class=\"image\"/>\n                              <figcaption id=\"caption-1179143\">\n                  <span class=\"icon caption-arrow icon-drop-indicator\"/>\n                                      <p class=\"caption\">\n                      Guided meditation options in the app.                    </p>\n                                                    </figcaption>\n                          </figure>\n          </li>\n              </ul>\n    </div>\n  \n\n<p>Leaf makes stress tracking more complicated than it should be because the device essentially says you will be highly sensitive to stress when you haven't been meeting your health goals. The app presumes that when you've been slacking on your movement, meditation, and sleep (and when you're close to That Time of the Month), you'll be more stressed out because your body isn't performing at its peak. Personally, I know when I haven't slept well or when I've missed a workout or two. I don't need to see those points laid out in an app to know when my body isn't in balance\u2014but others may have other priorities and responsibilities that get in the way of that kind of self-awareness.</p>\n<p>This isn't the most accurate way to determine stress levels because it's based on the accuracy of the information Leaf detects and the information you provide. The Leaf doesn't track heart rate either, so it won't be able to tell you if something physiologically strange is going on. While no fitness tracker or smartwatch can account for the mental factors that may cause stress, I trust devices with heart-rate monitors to provide insight into stress levels more than those without pulse sensors.</p>\n\n        </div>\n\n        \n                  </div></body></html>"}, "15430178": {"score": 3, "comments": ["I&#x27;ve been working through the tutorials on this: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.turbo360.co&#x2F;tutorials\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.turbo360.co&#x2F;tutorials</a>.

I have been working from home for years and it&#x27;s been a continual struggle.

Those have actively improved my life.  I&#x27;ve also spent thousands of hours looking at stupid pictures.  Hacker News has been more useful than Reddit, but still has been a large timesink.  But we all have our own set of sites.<p>For me, blocking apps did not work at all, because I can just disable them.  Unless I give up root access to my own computer, but that isn&#x27;t really going to work.  Having an &quot;accountability partner&quot; didn&#x27;t work.  I even did money challenges where I had to pay $500 to someone if I browsed Reddit.  I did one time pay some money, and after that the group stopped really believing we&#x27;d hold each other to it.<p>Guilting myself has stopped working.  But I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s really a solution anyway.<p>Cold turkey seems to not really help.  I&#x27;ll go for a while without doing the addicting thing, and then get really angsty and then binge.  Food can sometimes be this way this too.  Yo-yo dieting and yo-yo internet binging both seem harmful.<p>Some things that have helped me:<p>First, just becoming aware of what is happening.  I&#x27;ve been reading a lot about human psychology lately and came across the idea of &quot;Supernormal Stimuli,&quot; the idea that some modern things are incredibly addictive because our brain did not evolve in an environment where it had to deal with things like the internet, Doritos, and internet pornography.  This comic sums it up really well: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sparringmind.com&#x2F;supernormal-stimuli&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sparringmind.com&#x2F;supernormal-stimuli&#x2F;</a><p>If you can in any way limit the sources of infinite novelty, or get rid of the worst offenders that can help.  And I think all the sources contribute to make addiction harder to break.<p>And honestly not having internet at home did solve the problem - I&#x27;ve tried it twice.  But I work only from home and kind of need it to do work.  If I lived in a place that has better coffee shops, I might stick with that.<p>Speaking of which, leaving the house helps me.  I find I am not as willing to just slack off completely if there are other people around, so I am quite productive in Starbuckses.<p>No electronics in bed has helped a lot.  That alone has helped me not find myself staring at a device at 2am for no real reason.<p>Humans are creatures of habit and also lazy, and so one advice I&#x27;ve heard is to make the things you want to do as easy as possible and the things you don&#x27;t want to do as hard as possible.  If you can get away with not having internet at home, that might just be a way to solve the problem.<p>I don&#x27;t think there is a silver bullet, but continuing to try things has helped me find a few things that have helped me.  Also some of the above statements may not be completely accurate and I&#x27;m open to correction and further nuance.<p>Slowly over time I&#x27;ve seen myself become more and more self-controlled, though I&#x27;m of course not perfect.  I&#x27;m convinced that the default today is for people to be addicted and ineffective since humans did not at all evolve in this sort of environment, and so anyone who makes an effort to better themselves can become very effective in life.<p>Best of luck, and email me if you want to talk more.", "selfcontrol (the aptly named app) helps with self control.<p>I only use it on desktop to limit myself to productive online resources.

Read.<p>I&#x27;ve also discovered that it&#x27;s having a negative effect on my ability to focus. I used to read a book a week. I haven&#x27;t read a book since I got a smartphone. I can&#x27;t.<p>Anytime I&#x27;ve done a full computer detox I feel better within a week. My sleep schedule normalizes. My focus lengthens. My brain gets quieter and less compulsive. Time with friends and loved ones becomes deeper.<p>But I love coding. And I love programming for a living. And I love programming side projects. Programming isn&#x27;t really the problem. It&#x27;s a productiv focused creative act that also provides me a good living.<p>But programming takes place on the internet pretty much.

He knew that his brain would briefly keep on ticking after being severed from his body. <em>My last 10 seconds</em>, he said to himself, looking through the hole his tiny turbine-powered airplane had just punched through a trailer.</p>\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n\n    \n      \n        \n          <p class=\"associated-container\">\n            \n              \n            \n            \n\n            \n          </p>\n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n  <p>Skeletons of scrapped 747s cast shadows all around him. He\u2019d taken off from Mojave Air and Space Port, situated in a featureless Southern California plain, miles of nothing extending in every direction. Somehow he\u2019d still managed to crash into Mojave\u2019s aircraft cemetery\u00ad. Not as bad as hitting one of the populated airport buildings, obviously, but still impressive.</p>\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  <p>Gradually he became conscious of a voice, belonging to Justin Gillen, his airplane-building partner and a Scaled Composites engineer, screaming over his ruined headset. \u201cTower, I need to get to the boneyard right now!\u201d Gillen yelled, over and over.</p>\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  <p>Seguin, knowing Gillen couldn\u2019t hear or see him, stood up in the wreckage like Bruce Willis in a <em>Die Hard</em> sequel. He had a black eye. He needed a CT scan. But he was alive, and he watched Gillen drive over the dusty road toward their destroyed aircraft: a tiny, tandem-wing airplane to which they\u2019d added two jet engines. TWERP, they called it. <em>Had</em> called it. There wasn\u2019t much left.</p>\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n  <p>Seguin, 34, and Gillen, 37, are two of the most adventurous of a subset of Mojave aerospace designers who build and fly their own airplanes in their free time. And when there are no boards or bosses to answer to, they have the liberty of (within federal government limits) using a different metric for \u201crisk.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  <p>\u201cSure, it is safer to sit at my house,\u201d Seguin says, pulling back the tarp to show me TWERP\u2019s wreckage, which looks like a bunch of ripped-up packing material. \u201cBut I will never be like my heroes if I sit at my house.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  <p>TWERP\u2014for Twin Engine Research Project\u2014ended in pieces. But it began with Seguin and Gillen coveting their neighbor\u2019s goods.</p>\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  <h3>CATCH UP-22</h3>\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n  <p>Seguin started Wasabi Air Racing with his girlfriend (now wife), Jennifer Whaley, in 2007. Gillen joined them in the enterprise soon after. At the time, the three of them all worked for Scaled Composites; Gillen and Whaley still do. Seguin is now an experimental test pilot for Mooney International. Wasabi was just \u201cthe hobby of a few aviation dorks who use the company to get more experience designing, building, and testing cool airplanes,\u201d Seguin says.</p>\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  <p>They began modestly: In the 2008 Reno Air Races, Seguin flew a Cassutt he\u2019d bought from a Bay Area museum and repaired. He hung in through the Formula One Silver race, finishing eighth. He knew he didn\u2019t have a real shot at winning in that airplane; he just wanted to get some testing and racing experience.</p>\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  <p>And tinkering experience: The following year, Seguin and Gillen modified the Cassutt with a tighter cowling, increasing its top speed by 17 mph. Seguin finished in fourth place in the Formula One Bronze race.</p>\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  <p>After that, Seguin and Gillen focused on designing their own airplane. Their creation, the Wasabi Siren\u2014a white bullet powered by the Formula One category\u2019s requisite Continental O-200 engine\u2014first flew in 2012. Two years later, on July 28, 2014, Seguin set a world record in the Siren when it became the fastest piston-powered aircraft in its weight class to fly from Mojave to Oshkosh, Wisconsin, clocking a speed of 163.31 mph. \u201cThe cool thing for me was to set a record that effectively drew a line between the two Meccas for experimental aircraft: Mojave and Oshkosh,\u201d Seguin wrote in an email.</p>\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  <p>By 2013, he was ready to return to Reno. Flying the Siren, he finished in eighth place in the Formula One Gold Race. But he improved in each of the following two years, taking fourth place in 2014 and then third place in 2015, with a time of 6:33.844.</p>\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  <p>For a long time, Gillen and Seguin had been content to help each other with their own projects. Eventually they started getting offers from other pilots who wanted them to test their aircraft.</p>\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  <p>One of their first clients needed help with turbo controllers on a Continental TSIO-550 race engine. After the two worked on it, the aircraft, a Lancair Legacy, set four world records in three days at the 2015 Mojave Experimental Fly-in: two for Time to Climb to 3,000 Meters (2:03 and 1:59) and two for Speed Over a 3-Kilometer Course (391 and 388 mph).</p>\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  <p>Now Seguin owns a hangar at the Mojave airport (he also rents three others). The space is littered with project patches, fuselage molds, and empty energy-drink cans.</p>\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  <p>Mojave is full of caves like this one: While it\u2019s home to big-name customers like Scaled Composites and Virgin Galactic, its many smaller hangars belong to enthusiasts and employees who fly in their spare time. For some, it\u2019s just a hobby for blowing off steam. Others want to bolster their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s so they get noticed at work, standing out among the hundreds of other ambitious engineers and pilots.</p>\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  <p>Seguin and Gillen are in that second category. One day they spotted an opportunity in the hangar right next door: Hanging like a museum display was a Rutan Quickie Q1 homebuilt\u2014a featherweight taildragger designed by Scaled Composites founder Burt Rutan\u2014that had been abandoned by its original owner before it ever flew. Seguin and Gillen\u2019s neighbor had rescued it from the airport dumpster, then held onto it for a decade, always intending to do something with it.</p>\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  <p>Of the many oddball Rutan designs, the Quickie is one of the oddest. It has tandem wings, with the main gear located at the tips of the main wing. It has the profile of a wasp and the aura of a spaceship.</p>\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  <p>But this modification had never flown. Its controls weren\u2019t installed, nor were the electrical systems. The brakes needed to be tweaked.</p>\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n    \n        \n\n\n  \n\n  <div class=\"slideshow-wrapper\">\n            \n            \n\n            \n            <div class=\"slideshow\">\n                <a class=\"slideshow-prev GTM-slideshow-large-arrow\" title=\"Previous\">\n                    <i class=\"icon-large icon-chevron-left\"> </i>\n                </a>\n                <a class=\"slideshow-next GTM-slideshow-large-arrow\" title=\"Next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon-large icon-chevron-right\"> </i>\n                </a>\n\n                <div class=\"slideshow-slides\">\n                    <div class=\"slideshow-wrap\">\n                        \n                            \n                                \n                                    <div class=\"slide\">\n                                        <figure>\n                                            <img src=\"https://thumbs-prod.si-cdn.com/lAol5ta2mFZUf1BM_PjKW1J478U=/fit-in/1072x0/https://public-media.smithsonianmag.com/filer/0c/8c/0c8c77ae-50f2-43ee-aafb-412683a44084/11za_jj2017_img_3744crop_live.jpg\" alt=\"\"/>\n                                            <figcaption class=\"caption\">\n                                                Like many Formula One race pilots, Seguin (in the cockpit) debuted at the Reno air races in a Cassutt.\n                                                \n                                                    <span class=\"credits\">(Daren Kimura)</span>\n                                                \n                                                \n\n\n\n                                            </figcaption>\n                                        </figure>\n                                    </div>\n                                \n                            \n                                \n                                    <div class=\"slide\">\n                                        <figure>\n                                            <img src=\"https://thumbs-prod.si-cdn.com/vZ4E8M0pTECLz-yXniIdHFX0eXc=/fit-in/1072x0/https://public-media.smithsonianmag.com/filer/5e/70/5e704a82-8123-4e09-a45f-3e548ae70f25/11p_jj2017_img_20150920_193114517_hdr_live-wr.jpg\" alt=\"\"/>\n                                            <figcaption class=\"caption\">\n                                                Seguin's dad Drew and wife-to-be Jenn Whaley supported the 2008 attempt.

They\u2019d bring it up to spec and even do the tests necessary to secure its airworthiness certificate.</p>\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  <p>The owner agreed, encouraging the pair to \u201cdo something cool with it,\u201d Seguin recalls.</p>\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  <p>They pitched the owner several ideas, but he chose the one Seguin and Gillen had hoped he would go for: They would turn his wasp of an airplane into a jet.</p>\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  <p>Out went the 18-horsepower engine from a motor home generator. In its place they installed two PBS TJ-40s, each rated at 85 pounds of thrust.</p>\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  <p>Call it an upgrade.</p>\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  <h3>My Hobby, My Business</h3>\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  <p>Seguin described Wasabi\u2019s main business as \u201ccontract flight test.\u201d In his words, they \u201ctrade engineering and fabrication resources for exotic flight test experience.\u201d Sometimes this means finding homebuilts that other people have left unfinished and completing the jobs, perhaps with a modification or two, then certifying the airplanes so the owners can jump straight to Sunday joyrides.</p>\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  <p>In the case of the Quickie, they made short work of replacing its old 80-pound engine with 16 pounds of turbines, a modification that would demand 28 more gallons of fuel per hour. Replacing one heavy engine with two lightweight ones unbalanced the airplane, so more modifications were called for to make it stable. \u201cThe obvious solution is to put the new engines where the old one was,\u201d says Seguin. But then the hot exhaust, traveling the whole length of the airplane, would bake the fuselage.</p>\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  <p>Instead, they moved the engines to the back and added two additional fuel tanks\u2014one in the new nose and one under the rear wing spar\u2014and let gas flow between them. Then they built a new nose using a mold they had created from 50 pounds of foam purchased at a hardware store, and filled it with ballast to re-balance their airplane.</p>\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  <p>As they worked, they posted pictures and videos online. Their YouTube plays hit the tens of thousands in a day. And watching progress on #projectTWERP, people began to get excited: \u201cYou actually plan to fly that thing?!?!? This has quickly turned into my favorite Instagram acct,\u201d said one commenter.</p>\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  <p>Some of their Mojave peers disapprove of their habit of inviting the public to peek behind the curtain. Gillen himself used to feel this way, he says: Social media is for braggarts. One sponsor told Seguin the posts made him look like a fraud. If he were really doing such great work, he\u2019d just do it and stay quiet.</p>\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  <p>But Seguin\u2019s view is that the general public isn\u2019t living and breathing aviation the way his peers do. Isn\u2019t a little showing off warranted, he asks, if it helps get a new group of people interested in flight? He also says that posting their work in public forums invites feedback that he and his cohorts can use to do their jobs better\u2014a sort of informal peer review.</p>\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  <p>Gillen has come around to that opinion. Sharing is fun. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re a couple dudes who want to generate excitement about whatever, it\u2019s not going to happen without exposure,\u201d he says.</p>\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  <h3>Certified and Certifiable</h3>\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  <p>With engines and fuel tanks installed and aligned, Seguin and Gillen worked with the Federal Aviation Administration to get an airworthiness certificate for their airplane as an experimental craft. Because it didn\u2019t fit neatly into the turbojet category, they knew the bureaucratic wheels might require some greasing: They visited the FAA\u2019s Flight Standards District Office in Van Nuys\u2014about a 60-mile drive from Seguin\u2019s home in Chino\u00ad\u2014in person to talk officials through their unconventional project.</p>\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  <p>Finally, certificate in hand, they began dreaming of the future: setting a record on the three-kilometer (1.9-mile) closed course, flying higher than 6,000 meters, going longer than 250 miles. But like all things that go up, TWERP had to be tested on the ground first.</p>\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n    \n        \n\n\n  \n\n  <div class=\"slideshow-wrapper\">\n            \n            \n\n            \n            <div class=\"slideshow\">\n                <a class=\"slideshow-prev GTM-slideshow-large-arrow\" title=\"Previous\">\n                    <i class=\"icon-large icon-chevron-left\"> </i>\n                </a>\n                <a class=\"slideshow-next GTM-slideshow-large-arrow\" title=\"Next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon-large icon-chevron-right\"> </i>\n                </a>\n\n                <div class=\"slideshow-slides\">\n                    <div class=\"slideshow-wrap\">\n                        \n                            \n                                \n                                    <div class=\"slide\">\n                                        <figure>\n                                            <img src=\"https://thumbs-prod.si-cdn.com/Bo1h7KWN-AtmDMzWw7INGSXMoWM=/fit-in/1072x0/https://public-media.smithsonianmag.com/filer/c6/8b/c68bc5d3-9ea9-477e-a5b7-cb88ee09e5e1/11b_jj2017_tfi_quickie_02_live.jpg\" alt=\"\"/>\n                                            <figcaption class=\"caption\">\n                                                TWERP on its second flight, with Seguin in the cockpit, as photographed by Gillen from his own aircraft, <em>Tango Time Machine.</em>\n                                                \n                                                    <span class=\"credits\">(Doug Glover)</span>\n                                                \n                                                \n\n\n\n                                            </figcaption>\n                                        </figure>\n                                    </div>\n                                \n                            \n                                \n                                    <div class=\"slide\">\n                                        <figure>\n                                            <img src=\"https://thumbs-prod.si-cdn.com/OGGKWn9swMFWVDFOwCFRKQO-nK0=/fit-in/1072x0/https://public-media.smithsonianmag.com/filer/69/b8/69b8a637-7add-4abb-84c3-0ce973870a44/11o_jj2017_nm_160409_breakingtheday_0005_live.jpg\" alt=\"\"/>\n                                            <figcaption class=\"caption\">\n                                                Seguin inspects TWERP on the ground. After the May 2016 crash last year, he suffered a crisis of confidence.\n                                                \n                                                    <span class=\"credits\">(Nick Miller)</span>\n                                                \n                                                \n\n\n\n                                            </figcaption>\n                                        </figure>\n                                    </div>\n                                \n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            </div>\n                        \n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  <p>And there, a problem immediately flew up at them: When the engines ran at low power, they sometimes died. The engines sucked a lot of battery power at the start, they found, so when the airplane idled on the runway, the system voltage dipped, and the engines shut off. It was an easy fix: They just agreed that right after every spool-up, they would run the engines at a minimum of 40 percent power for two minutes to charge the battery.</p>\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  <p>\u201cI think we both knew that we hadn\u2019t licked the engine failure problem all the way,\u201d says Gillen, \u201cbut we had rationalized it by saying that the worst place for the engine to fail is on the takeoff run.\u201d In that scenario, Mojave\u2019s 12,000-foot runway gave them plenty of room to land safely after liftoff.</p>\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  <p>They moved on to taxi testing, with Seguin and Gillen taking turns gunning the airplane up and down the runway. TWERP was shifty in its ground handling, but in exactly the same quirky ways all Quickies were\u2014not in ways that pointed fingers at their engines.</p>\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  <p>It was time to fly.</p>\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  <p>On May 13, 2016, the first two flights went off without any hitches, shutdowns, or spinouts. Fire poured from the engines\u2019 nozzles, and the airplane went up and came down. It was a little scary, this unproven machine, but they trusted their build; they trusted their tests; they trusted themselves. They wouldn\u2019t have gone up if they thought something would go wrong.</p>\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  <p>Resting up from the two initial flights, Seguin and Gillen sat in the Voyager restaurant at Mojave with a Red Bull film crew, there to shoot Seguin and Gillen for a TV special. The walls were adorned with maps of famous flight paths and portraits of aviation heroes, and the team could watch all manner of aircraft taxi by while they ate their pancakes. They talked, as one does, about the weather.</p>\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  <p>The desert winds were up, and forecast to stay that way. But as they ate, the air calmed.</p>\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  <p>\u201cMan, it would be great to get one more flight off,\u201d Seguin said. In his memory, the team agreed it was a good idea. Or maybe he means that no one actively objected; Gillen remembers it differently. \u201cI long ago decided that Elliot makes his own decisions on go or no-go, and I would do the same for myself,\u201d he says. \u201cI thought, \u2018Well, I wouldn\u2019t do that, but it\u2019s not me.\u2019\u00a0\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  <p>Seguin and Gillen now go back and forth about the decision. Was it simply \u201cKodak courage\u201d\u2014going forward with a feat you shouldn\u2019t just because the Red Bull cameras were there? Or was it an informed decision that just happened to turn out poorly?</p>\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  <h3>Third Time\u2019s the Harm</h3>\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  <p>For the third flight, Seguin taxied hard down the runway, just as before. And TWERP lifted up, just as before. But as soon as Seguin was at altitude, the winds reappeared. \u201cThe weird thing was they didn\u2019t come right up,\u201d he recalls. \u201cThey were kind of gasping through the area.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  <p>He pulled the engine power to idle and started descent. The ground approached, the Joshua trees and cars on Highway 58 appearing larger underneath him. But five feet from touchdown, a gust blew up from the right. Suddenly, the airplane rolled 45 degrees. He couldn\u2019t land like that.</p>\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n    \n        \n\n\n  \n\n  <div class=\"slideshow-wrapper\">\n            \n            \n\n            \n            <div class=\"slideshow\">\n                <a class=\"slideshow-prev GTM-slideshow-large-arrow\" title=\"Previous\">\n                    <i class=\"icon-large icon-chevron-left\"> </i>\n                </a>\n                <a class=\"slideshow-next GTM-slideshow-large-arrow\" title=\"Next\">\n                    <i class=\"icon-large icon-chevron-right\"> </i>\n                </a>\n\n                <div class=\"slideshow-slides\">\n                    <div class=\"slideshow-wrap\">\n                        \n                            \n                                \n                                    <div class=\"slide\">\n                                        <figure>\n                                            <img src=\"https://thumbs-prod.si-cdn.com/7a1xBOVyRBL0JiMhjeDh3F-nWWE=/fit-in/1072x0/https://public-media.smithsonianmag.com/filer/e7/aa/e7aa6047-12d8-4559-a40a-bec7fb2be997/11e_jj2017_nzm_160513_elliotseguin_09_live.jpg\" alt=\"\"/>\n                                            <figcaption class=\"caption\">\n                                                High-speed taxi tests of TWERP at Mojave bore out that the Quickie was tricky to handle even on land.\n                                                \n                                                    <span class=\"credits\">(Nick Miller)</span>\n                                                \n                                                \n\n\n\n                                            </figcaption>\n                                        </figure>\n                                    </div>\n                                \n                            \n                                \n                                    <div class=\"slide\">\n                                        <figure>\n                                            <img src=\"https://thumbs-prod.si-cdn.com/Oey8HN8q84VkvvGoAnOM4xJVNqc=/fit-in/1072x0/https://public-media.smithsonianmag.com/filer/59/a8/59a8c9cc-9f6e-45db-bb66-2a7a7955141f/11s_jj2017_img_2335_live-wr.jpg\" alt=\"\"/>\n                                            <figcaption class=\"caption\">\n                                                The wreckage in the boneyard, after the crash-landing\n                                                \n                                                    <span class=\"credits\">(Elliot Seguin)</span>\n                                                \n                                                \n\n\n\n                                            </figcaption>\n                                        </figure>\n                                    </div>\n                                \n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            </div>\n                        \n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  <p>He pushed the engines to full power, intending to ascend and come back around. But just as the turbines\u2019 thrust pressed him into his seat and the nose lifted, he heard the silence no pilot ever wants to hear: an engine, gone.</p>\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  <p>The airplane was still tilted from the gust, and tilted into the now-dead engine. The nose was slicing to the left. And as soon as he could see over it, Seguin realized it was pointing right toward the hard, heavy, jagged 747s of the boneyard.</p>\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  <p>Although the Wasabi protocols\u2014which accounted for an engine out\u2014dictated that the pilot shut the second engine off and land straight ahead, his airplane was so skewed that there was no \u201cstraight ahead.\u201d Seguin kept the right engine on and willed the airplane to climb. But he knew that the more power he gave, the less control he would have, and the less power he gave, the sooner he was going down\u2014right into the side of a leftover Lufthansa.</p>\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  <p>He frantically tried different power levels, different controls. It was no use. \u201cI\u2019m looking at where I\u2019m going to go, and it\u2019s the worst place,\u201d he says.</p>\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  <p>He dove TWERP between two 747s. The small volume of air between the metallic hulks and his wingtips whizzed. But he\u2019d avoided them only to find himself staring at the side of a Convair.</p>\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  <p>Increasing the power and pulling away, he soon found two more 747s in his view. He couldn\u2019t go over; he couldn\u2019t go between.

Right wing sheared at fuselage. Both engines sheared at fuselage. Canopy destroyed\u2026.\u201d That doesn\u2019t capture the effect it had on him: Along with a black eye and a dent in his helmet, the crash gave him an existential crisis. For a long time afterward, he panicked on every flight he made.</p>\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  <p>\u201cIt took 40 or 50 landings [for the panic to abate] and it took half that to figure out what it was,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was \u2018Oh, you\u2019re about to die.\u2019\u00a0\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  <p>Though it\u2019s been a year since the crash, Seguin says it doesn\u2019t seem to have hurt their business. Some at Mojave say they knew all along that modifying the airplane was ill-advised. But that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re right. Sometimes a gust just comes, an engine just fails, and you just find yourself headed into a field filled with airliners.</p>\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  <p>That\u2019s what bothers Seguin most. \u201cThere\u2019s a recognition that there\u2019s a limit to what I can control,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd the other side of that limit is really scary.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  <p>But he\u2019s come around to this: He\u2019s glad he smelled what he calls \u201cthe breath of the dragon.\u201d It\u2019s changed him. And he knows that in the face of a monster, he won\u2019t freeze up: He\u2019ll work the problem, always. Even if it means choosing between crashing into an empty 747 or crashing into a trailer.</p>\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  <p>Soon, he and Gillen plan to put those same turbines on another small airplane\u2014maybe a Cessna\u2014and take a new fire-breather into the skies.</p>\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  <div class=\"external-associated-products\">\n    <section class=\"article-teaser special-article\">\n        <a href=\"https://subscribe.airspacemag.com/airspace.php?idx=240&amp;inetz=article-text-link-L-C&amp;ipromo=%7Cperm%7Csub%7C54pct%7Ctext%7C%7Cblue%7C%7Cprice-ctrl\" class=\"thumbnail\" target=\"_blank\">\n            <img src=\"https://thumbs-prod.si-cdn.com/IbJ-Q5FHoATWdGhTn-h9cGlRrM0=/fit-in/300x0/https://public-media.smithsonianmag.com/embedly/JJ2017_-_Web_Cover.jpg\" title=\"Subscribe to Air &amp;

It is none less than the whole society.</p>\n<p>Psychologist <a href=\"https://www.google.gr/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiD_sa_jdzWAhUoCcAKHd0UAEsQFggqMAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ursula-nuber.de%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw1ftjBjmGitgxUbXzexsfEo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ursula Nuber</a> writes in her book \u201c<a href=\"https://www.google.gr/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiBgcWyjdzWAhXmA8AKHY-_BaYQFggqMAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.de%2FDas-elfte-Gebot-Gelassenheit-meistern%2Fdp%2F3426654938&amp;usg=AOvVaw3kqEhGLC8LUrMGLFOOhbyn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Das 11.Gebot- Mit Gelassenheit das Leben meistern</a>\u201d, that the society is firmly convinced that beautiful people lead a happy life. Thereupon, people and especially young people strive to outward beauty, and think that they have to be beautiful to lead a happy life.</p>\n<p>And indeed, numerous studies prove that <strong>beautiful people</strong> have many <strong>advantages</strong> in their society. An US American psychologist <a href=\"https://www.google.gr/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=4&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjr4dDTjdzWAhVEOMAKHb45B44QFghDMAM&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ritafreedman.com%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw0RZ1s4txSixfc5Oy8-6Vav\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Rita Freedmann</a> explains \u201cMothers react more frequently to their babies when they are pretty.\u201d This means they receive more attention and love, which increases the well-being of their babies.</p>\n<p>But which body structure and which external features make a beautiful person, always depends on the respective society.</p>\n<p>The <strong>beauty</strong> ideals of our present society are long legs, full lips, big breasts, narrow waist, big eyes and a small nose. People who do not have these characteristics are automatically excluded from the \u201cbeauty ones\u201d of the society. On the other hand, it is seems that <strong>ugly people</strong> often look stupid, more unsympathetic, with no self-confidence, uncreative, lonely, listless, dissatisfied, self-dependent and untried. From the very beginning, you feel that ugly people do not have friends, go alone through life and go out less, are generally sad. Also, they have fewer partners and get a job harder.</p>\n<h3>But is this the real life of \u201cugly people\u201d?</h3>\n<p>Surveys have shown that <strong>beautiful people</strong> with more <strong>self-esteem</strong> are more faithful and present with the result to advertise themselves better than ugly people.</p>\n<p>This means at the second eye, that the most important is not the external appearance, but the way we exist and the enormity we practice in various situations in our lives. By saying the above, we have to notice that <strong>ugly people</strong> have to try more to achieve aims and conquer things in their lives than <strong>beautiful people</strong>, who are externally more acceptable in our society. This points to the fact that the reach to a goal with great effort and difficulty and finally success, makes people feel automatically happier than someone who did not bother to do it. Even great names, such as Cleopatra and Maria Felix, may have been<strong> beautiful women</strong> of their time, but they stayed in history not for their beauty but for their intelligence, charisma and <strong>self-confidence</strong>.</p>\n<p>Well or wrongly, no one is the same as the other. We all differ externally and internally. And that\u2019s good. We are different and above all we are unique in this world. Don\u2019t forget that <strong>beautiful people</strong> have also their own complexes. Many of these \u201cbeauties\u201d have nothing to give to society but their beauty. Inside them they are empty and have nothing to offer. You can\u2019t buy charisma and self-confidence, nor beauty.</p>\n<p>The psychologist Alexandra Emm. Vasila said: \u201cOutdoor beauty can\u2019t replace the character, the personality, the behavior, the wit, the talent, the creativity \u2026\u201d Beauty is not the issue, but the way you find to take your interest into someone, the confidence you will transfer, your courtesy, your humor and the intelligence you own. This skill transcends the outer beauty and goes into the love you will initially show to yourself. Love yourself and you will see that those around you will love you too. Nobody is perfect. And if you do not think you are beautiful in your society, remind yourself that you are simply at the wrong society. In another one, you may have been nice, maybe not. It doesn\u2019t matter, because as ugly as you are considered, you may feel so lucky, happy and blessed, because you are not left in his outward appearance. You know that you are not accepted externally. The affect? You try to reveal other features that stand out. And that\u2019s it the point. Anyway, the beauty sometime goes away, but the true inner beauty of human stays.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Ugliness and beauty are strictly related with our character.\u00a0 Read our following article:<a href=\"https://www.mottocosmos.com/egoism-humility-thats-question/\"> Egoism or humility?

By the time we all woke up to what we did, it was too late; the Nazis were emboldened, chanting in the streets of Virginia, among many places. Then a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/08/cloudflare-ceo-the-people-behind-the-daily-stormer-are-assholes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">guy woke up</a>, literally, and decided to kick the Nazis off the internet, until they find a new home.</p>\n<figure>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cI woke up this morning in a bad mood and decided to kick them off the Internet.\u201d</p></blockquote><figcaption class=\"source\">\u2014 Matthew Prince, Cloudflare CEO</figcaption></figure>\n<p>For some observers of the technology, this latest kerfuffle might just be a new chapter in the upcoming book by a Vanity Fair writer. For those a bit more in the know, they would note that the Nazis (a word I am using as a short for white supremacists), never really left the internet. They practically populated the every platform you did; they were on newsgroups, mailing lists, 4chan, reddit, Facebook, Twitter, and probably still are.</p>\n<p>But, go down a bit farther back in the Wayback Machine, and it\u2019s easy to remember that Nazis and some part of their history was on the internet as far as 2000s, and it points to one of the most interesting tensions of the Internet with capital I; the constant tension between the borderlessness of it, yet the levers of it being controlled just a few. This is subject of this essay; how the current gatekeepers of the internet\u2019s aims to create a new type of statelessness state is just a clumsy reiteration of past attempts.</p>\n<figure>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cYour legal concepts of property, expression, identity, movement, and context do not apply to us. They are all based on matter, and there is no matter here.\u201d</p></blockquote><figcaption class=\"source\">\u2014 John Perry Barlow, EFF CO-Founder</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The aspirational extraterrestrial culture of the internet is a messy and deep subject but the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Declaration of Independence of Cyberspace</a>\u201d is a good start. Penned by John Perry Barlow, one of the founders of Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), at a World Economic Forum, the declaration pulls no punches. In fact, more than just statelessness, you can hear the subtext of cyberspace being not just an international entity but almost an supranational one. It is a good read, both as a way to understand the libertarian thinking of early residents of the cyberspace and also as a Marxist approach to how zero marginal cost of production of technology changes the entire dynamics of economy and of course societies. It is also remarkably prescient, not necessarily in the types of world early adopters would eventually create but the conflicts they would face.</p>\n<p>Scroll your way up to 2000. Not just to the days Before iPhone or Before Facebook but <em>Before Google</em>. In 2000, a French human-rights organization discovers that Yahoo, on its auction platform, allows sale of Nazi and Third Reich memorabilia. While still not tasteful and unpresidential at the time, such activity was not illegal under US law, but quite so under French law. In what\u2019s considered a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LICRA_v._Yahoo!\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">landmark case</a>, French court eventually ordered Yahoo to not just pull such items from its French store (fr.yahoo.com) but also make the items in the US store inaccessible in France.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.ramblingspace.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/3740159059_da82c90772_o.jpg?w=525&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Front page of the internet, 2000\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/> Front page of the internet, 2000</p>\n<p>The entire <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2000/nov/20/internetnews.freespeech\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">discourse around the case</a> is extremely fascinating, and some of the statements from both sides have a very timeless quality. To an American audience, where only freedom of speech is more paramount to right to carry a firearm, an interference by a French court of all courts, is an international overreach of unseen proportions. However, this analysis misses the continent-wide trauma Europeans experienced with Nazism in 1940s. While America has its fair share of World War 2 scars, it pales in comparison to the destruction Europe endured. This suffering was so profound, so widespread and so deep, and Nazism such a vile idea that the entire continent\u2019s new identity, European Union is largely built around this reaction.</p>\n<p>It is worth pulling out a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/aug/11/qanda.simonjeffery\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">few quotes here</a> especially, just to see how prescient some of the predictions from the French philosophers are. Mark Knoebel, the French activist whose letters sparked the entire shebang says that American internet is becoming a \u201cdumping ground\u201d for racists all over.</p>\n<p>Any discussion of censorship on the internet would be amiss without bringing up everyone\u2019s once-favorite liberal reformer turned autocrat strongmen Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the president of Turkey. Even as far back as 2008, just 4 years after Google\u2019s IPO, the Turkish government was in cahoots with YouTube over a couple of videos making fun of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of modern Turkish Republic. In what would become the norm for Turkish government (or already was, depending on your ethnicity in Turkey), the state decided to block YouTube entirely, and demand the videos be taken down. The case went on for literally years, during which time YouTube stayed blocked in Turkey for almost two years. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2008/08/17/web-censorship-is-so-bad-in-turkey-that-blogs-are-shutting-themselves-down-in-protest/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Turkish bloggers took the matters to their hands</a>, where they shut down their own sites to protest the government\u2019s block. However, the block itself was so ham-fisted that even the then Prime Minister Erdogan himself mentioned that \u201ceveryone knows how to access YouTube\u201d.</p>\n<figure>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cI think the Decider model is an inconsistent model because the Internet is big and Google isn\u2019t the only one making the decisions\u201d</p></blockquote><figcaption class=\"source\">\u2014 Nicole Wong, Google</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Still, the details of this 2008 already signals the awkward situations tech companies would themselves with government.\u00a0Impossible to imagine now, though,\u00a0Google employees felt comfortable jokingly calling themselves <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/30/magazine/30google-t.html\">\u201cThe Decider</a>\u201d with a New York Times journalist in the room. The employees in charge, many with law degrees, were aware of their power, felt obviously uncomfortable with the levers they held, but, in the end they held on to them.</p>\n<p>A common theme that underlies most of the Silicon Valley thinking is that computers, internet and associated technologies changes everything; from mode of production to distribution to how information is generated to how it is disseminated.\u00a0No incumbent is too big to not upend, no industry without with inefficiencies a couple of scripts can eliminate. A common complaint of the less-STEM focused side of the world, then is that Silicon Valley\u2019s casual disregard for the history and the rules of the world is bordering on recklessness.</p>\n<p>This is largely a political argument, which means it\u2019s an <em>everything</em> argument, but the singular point is that sometimes the Internet company\u2019s casual disregard for history is not just hurtful for the entire world, but also for themselves (a statement whose irony is quite obvious to yours truly).</p>\n<p>Silicon Valley companies love to invoke <a href=\"http://opentranscripts.org/transcript/beyond-legal-talismans/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">legal talismans</a>, a phrase (I think) coined by <a href=\"https://kendraalbert.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kendra Albert</a>. In short, they love to evoke feelings of a legal proceeding, such as a due process, where there is none, to mostly justify their own decision making. But sometimes, such invocations are just symptoms of delusions of grandeur and they do come with consequences for everyone, as mentioned, including the companies themselves.</p>\n<p>Consider the time Twitter UK General Manager called Twitter not just a bastion of free speech but the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/mar/22/twitter-tony-wang-free-speech\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">free speech wing of the free speech party</a>\u201d in 2012 and try not to cringe. But you can definitely see a direct line from the EFF declaration to such an inane statement. A new world is being born, called the cyberspace (as opposed to what, meatspace?) and the rules are written by whoever is creating this world. Considering the current situation Twitter find itself in right now, with user growth barely chugging along, a stock hugely under its IPO levels, its value possibly <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2017/08/17/trump-worth-to-twitter/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">held up significantly</a> by an orange White House resident, it\u2019s hard to imagine Twitter would be behaving the same way if they had a better understanding of the nuances of free speech laws, and how it protects people from state because, unlike corporations, state is allowed to jail and sometimes, kill, its people.</p>\n<figure>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cThat means more than one-sixteenth of the average user\u2019s waking time is spent on Facebook\u201d</p></blockquote>\n</figure>\n<p>Of course, this aspirational statelessness of guardians of the cyberspace does go the other way too. It\u2019s easy to write off your overzealous application of freedom of speech as a mistake, \u00a0but harder to do, when you do the opposite. When a tech company counts \u00a0\u2153 of the world\u2019s population as its users (and <a href=\"http://www.pewinternet.org/2016/11/11/social-media-update-2016/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">80% of online Americans</a>), and those users spend a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/06/business/facebook-bends-the-rules-of-audience-engagement-to-its-advantage.html?mcubz=1&amp;_r=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">considerable amount of their waking moments</a> looking at things pushed on to them by that company, it\u2019s practically impossible to for a one-in-a-million event to not happen with exceeding frequency when you are dealing with billions.</p>\n<p>Probably one of the more eye-opening cases of this American overreach into cultures involves bodies, or more specifically naked ones. For Americans, a sight of a covered breast at a sporting event is a cause of national debate, but for many Northern Europeans, nudity is just another state of undress, as normal as any other. Especially so, when it is presented in a historical, artistic or just non-sexualized context. And even more especially so, when it is the Conservative Norwegian Prime Minister who happens to share a Pulitzer-prize winning photo. Is Facebook, run largely by a bunch of white men in America, not making cultural statements about an unashamedly progressive country?</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.ramblingspace.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/napalm-girl-88f02cbaad205d1edf5f19e683c39e6cb4df9c3c-s700-c85.jpg?w=525&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Banned in California\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/> Banned in California</p>\n<p>It is easy to write off these high profile instances as simple mistakes, and having worked in a similar user-generated content site before, it is mind-blowing to me that Facebook is as free of spam as it is. But what does that mean when these types of \u00a0incidents happen so often that you slowly start shifting values of other cultures to your own, which whether you like it or not, were shaped by your own American upbringing? One cannot just create a culture in such a transactional manner.</p>\n<p>It is one thing, as an academic exercise to imagine a world without governments, a libertarian paradise.\u00a0And if someone wants to take his academic exercise to the <a href=\"https://www.seasteading.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">seas</a> or to other planets, it is only within their rights to do so.</p>\n<p>But for a generation that wants to eventually not just govern the cyberspace but also one of the most <a href=\"https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2017/05/15/sam-altman-may-run-for-california-governor.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">important states in the world</a>, the utter clumsiness of the entire enterprise should give one a pause. A common joke in Silicon Valley, the place about the Silicon Valley, the hit HBO show is that many of the absurd plot twists in the series is really toned down to be believable to the general public.</p>\n<p>Consider the case of Reddit. When a bunch of celebrity\u2019s iCloud accounts got hacked and their private photos were posted on the site, the company decided, reasonably, to remove that content. But in doing so, the CEO of the company said that they were <a href=\"https://redditblog.com/2014/09/06/every-man-is-responsible-for-his-own-soul/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">considering reddit</a> not just a private company, but \u201ca government for a new type of community\u201d. He even went to describe how he sees the actions by the moderators akin to law enforcement officers. But, how do you reconcile such great ambition with the fact that your CEO, or president, resigns from the government because of a <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2014/11/14/reddit_ceo_resigns_why_didn_t_reddit_want_to_move_to_daly_city.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">seating arrangement</a> issue? (Disclaimer: I worked at a Reddit competitor briefly, around 7 years ago, partly because I was and still am quite interested in the space. I even wore a Reddit t-shirt when they came to visit us)</p>\n<figure>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cWe consider ourselves not just a company running a website where one can post links and discuss them, but the government of a new type of community\u201d</p></blockquote><figcaption class=\"source\">\u2014 Yishan Wong, Former Reddit CEO</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Building a new world, one that is more just, more humane, one that is safer, cleaner, more efficient all great goals. When I decided to study computer science in 2005, my main motivation was similar. I grew up in a town in Turkey where I didn\u2019t always fit in and it was through the internet where I could see more of the world easily enough and find people that I could connect with, on many levels. I wanted to extend that world, which seemed reasonably better than the one I lived in, more to the real world.</p>\n<p>And personal politics matter too.\u00a0As an immigrant to US, unlike most of my more left-leaning friends, I find the idea of statelessness, or a post-nation-state world an experiment that humanity owes itself to try. While the supranational organizations such as the EU and World Trade Organization do have their flaws and globalization comes with this unsettling feeling of homogeneity, I stay largely optimistic that as a species, we are better off in a more integrated society.</p>\n<p>However, that does not mean I advocate for a world where we outsource our thinking, our values, our cultures, our judicial decisions and certainly not our free press wholesale to a small number of people, who are unelected, unvetted, and largely unaccountable.</p>\n<p>What I would like to see, however is less of the reckless attitude but a more thoughtful approach.

But it\u2019s harder than it seems: either your system is the fastest and you make the trade, or you get nothing. <br/><br/>This is a considerable challenge for any C++ developer - the critical path is only a fraction of the total codebase, it is invoked infrequently and unpredictably, yet must execute quickly and without delay. Unfortunately we can\u2019t rely on the help of compilers, operating systems and standard hardware, as they typically aim for maximum throughput and fairness across all processes. <br/><br/>This talk describes how successful low latency trading systems can be developed in C++, demonstrating common coding techniques used to reduce execution times. While automated trading is used as the motivation for this talk, the topics discussed are equally valid to other domains such as game development and soft real-time processing.<br/>\u2014 <br/>Carl Cook: Optiver, Software Engineer<br/><br/>Carl has a Ph.D. from the University of Canterbury, New Zealand, graduating in 2006. He currently works for Optiver, a global electronic market maker, where he is tasked with adding new trading features into the execution stack while continually reducing latencies. Carl is also an active member of SG14, making sure that requirements from the automated trading industry are represented. He is currently assisting with several proposals, including non-allocating standard functions, fast containers, and CPU affinity/cache control.<br/>\u2014<br/>Videos Filmed &amp; Edited by Bash Films: <a href=\"/redirect?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.BashFilms.com&amp;redir_token=fs9k9mUx6BUs1tuFHOwsCwFT2rp8MTUwNzY4MTk0MkAxNTA3NTk1NTQy&amp;event=video_description&amp;v=NH1Tta7purM\" class=\"yt-uix-sessionlink  \" data-target-new-window=\"True\" data-url=\"/redirect?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.BashFilms.com&amp;redir_token=fs9k9mUx6BUs1tuFHOwsCwFT2rp8MTUwNzY4MTk0MkAxNTA3NTk1NTQy&amp;event=video_description&amp;v=NH1Tta7purM\" data-sessionlink=\"itct=CDAQ6TgYACITCJKylIbn5NYCFVDAHQodtqYHKCj4HUiz9ab32vbUvjQ\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.BashFilms.com</a></p></div>  </div></body></html>"}, "15430838": {"score": 2, "comments": ["No it didn&#x27;t.

Has there been an equal effort to add \u2018real\u2019 languages/glyph\u00a0systems/etc?</p>\n<p>And as always, if you don\u2019t have anything to say on that topic, feel free to choose your own.\u00a0:p</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n<p>I mean, each release of Unicode lists major new additions right at the top \u2014 <a href=\"http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode10.0.0/#Summary\">Unicode 10</a>, <a href=\"http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode9.0.0/#Summary\">Unicode 9</a>, <a href=\"http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode8.0.0/#Summary\">Unicode 8</a>, etc.  They also keep fastidious notes, so you can also dig into how and why these new scripts came from, by reading e.g. <a href=\"http://www.unicode.org/L2/L2015/15337-zanabazar-square.pdf\">the proposal for the addition of Zanabazar Square</a>.  I don\u2019t think I have much to add here; I\u2019m not a real linguist, I only play one on <span class=\"caps\">TV</span>.</p>\n<p>So with that out of the way, here\u2019s something completely\u00a0different!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>JavaScript was created in seven days, about eight thousand years ago.  It was pretty rough, and it stayed rough for most of its life.  But that was fine, because no one used it for anything besides having a trail of sparkles follow your mouse on their Xanga\u00a0profile.</p>\n<p>Then people discovered you could actually do a handful of useful things with JavaScript, and it saw a sharp uptick in usage.  Alas, it stayed pretty rough.  So we came up with polyfills and jQuerys and all kinds of miscellaneous things that tried to smooth over the rough parts, to varying degrees of\u00a0success.</p>\n<p>And\u2026  that\u2019s it.  That\u2019s pretty much how things stayed for a\u00a0while.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>I have complicated feelings about JavaScript.  I don\u2019t <em>hate</em> it\u2026  but I certainly don\u2019t <em>enjoy</em> it, either.  It has some pretty neat ideas, like prototypical inheritance and \u201ceverything is a value\u201d, but it buries them under a pile of annoying quirks and a woefully inadequate standard library.  The <span class=\"caps\">DOM</span> APIs don\u2019t make things much better \u2014 they seem to be designed as though the target language were Java, rarely taking advantage of any interesting JavaScript features.  And the places where the APIs overlap with the language are a hilarious mess: I have to check documentation <em>every single time</em> I use any <span class=\"caps\">API</span> that returns a set of things, because there are at least three totally different conventions for handling that and I can\u2019t keep them\u00a0straight.</p>\n<p>The funny thing is that I\u2019ve been fairly happy to work with Lua, even though it shares most of the same obvious quirks as JavaScript.  Both languages are weakly typed; both treat nonexistent variables and keys as simply false values, rather than errors; both have a single data structure that doubles as both a list and a map; both use 64-bit floating-point as their only numeric type (though Lua added integers very recently); both lack a standard object model; both have very tiny standard libraries.  Hell, Lua doesn\u2019t even have exceptions, not really \u2014 you have to fake them in much the same style as\u00a0Perl.</p>\n<p>And yet none of this bothers me nearly as much in Lua.  The <em>differences</em> between the languages are very subtle, but combined they make a huge\u00a0impact.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Lua has separate operators for addition and concatenation, so <code>+</code> is never ambiguous.  It also has <code>printf</code>-style string formatting in the standard\u00a0library.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Lua\u2019s method calls are syntactic sugar: <code>foo:bar()</code> just means <code>foo.bar(foo)</code>.  Lua doesn\u2019t even have a special <code>this</code> or <code>self</code> value; the invocant just becomes the first argument.  In contrast, JavaScript invokes some hand-waved magic to set its contextual <code>this</code> variable, which has led to no end of\u00a0confusion.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Lua has an <a href=\"https://eev.ee/blog/2016/11/18/iteration-in-one-language-then-all-the-others/\">iteration protocol</a>, as well as built-in iterators for dealing with list-style or map-style data.  JavaScript has a special dedicated <code>Array</code> type and clumsy built-in iteration\u00a0syntax.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Lua has operator overloading and (surprisingly flexible) module\u00a0importing.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Lua allows the keys of a map to be any value (though non-scalars are always compared by identity).  JavaScript implicitly converts keys to strings \u2014 and since there\u2019s no operator overloading, there\u2019s no way to natively fix\u00a0this.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are fairly minor differences, in the grand scheme of language design.  And almost every feature in Lua is implemented in a ridiculously simple way; in fact the entire language is described in complete detail in a <a href=\"https://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/manual.html\">single web page</a>.  So writing JavaScript is always frustrating for me: the language is <em>so close</em> to being much more ergonomic, and yet, it\u00a0isn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>Or, so I thought.  As it turns out, while I\u2019ve been off doing other stuff for a few years, browser vendors have been implementing all this pie-in-the-sky stuff from \u201c<span class=\"caps\">ES5</span>\u201d and \u201c<span class=\"caps\">ES6</span>\u201d, whatever those are.  People even upgrade their browsers now.  Lo and behold, the last time I went to write JavaScript, I found out that a number of papercuts had actually been <em>solved</em>, and the solutions were sufficiently widely available that I could actually <em>use them in web code</em>.</p>\n<p>The weird thing is that I <em>do</em> hear a lot about JavaScript, but the feature I\u2019ve seen raved the most about <em>by far</em> is probably\u2026  built-in types for working with arrays of bytes?  That\u2019s cool and all, but not exactly the most pressing concern for\u00a0me.</p>\n<p>Anyway, if you also haven\u2019t been keeping tabs on the world of JavaScript, here are some things we\u00a0missed.</p>\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let\"><span class=\"caps\">MDN</span> docs</a> \u2014 supported in Firefox 44, Chrome 41, <span class=\"caps\">IE</span> 11, Safari\u00a010</em></p>\n<p>I\u2019m pretty sure I first saw <code>let</code> over a decade ago.  Firefox has supported it for ages, but you actually had to <em>opt in</em> by specifying JavaScript version 1.7.  Remember JavaScript versions?  You know, from back in the days when people actually <a href=\"http://www.webreference.com/js/column26/version.html\">suggested you write stuff like this</a>:</p>\n<table class=\"highlighttable\"><tr><td class=\"linenos\"/><td class=\"code\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span/><span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nt\">SCRIPT</span> <span class=\"na\">LANGUAGE</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s\">\"JavaScript1.2\"</span> <span class=\"na\">TYPE</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s\">\"text/javascript\"</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n</pre></div>\n</td></tr></table>\n\n<p>Yikes.</p>\n<p>Anyway, so, <code>let</code> declares a variable \u2014 but scoped to the immediately containing <em>block</em>, unlike <code>var</code>, which scopes to the innermost <em>function</em>.  The trouble with <code>var</code> was that it was very easy to make\u00a0misleading:</p>\n<table class=\"highlighttable\"><tr><td class=\"linenos\"/><td class=\"code\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span/><span class=\"c1\">// foo exists here</span>\n<span class=\"k\">while</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"kc\">true</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"kd\">var</span> <span class=\"nx\">foo</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">...;</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">...</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n<span class=\"c1\">// foo exists here too</span>\n</pre></div>\n</td></tr></table>\n\n<p>If you reused the same temporary variable name in a different block, or if you expected to be shadowing an outer <code>foo</code>, or if you were trying to do something with creating closures in a loop, this would cause you some\u00a0trouble.</p>\n<p>But no more, because <code>let</code> actually scopes the way it looks like it should, the way variable declarations do in C and friends.  As an added bonus, if you refer to a variable declared with <code>let</code> <em>outside</em> of where it\u2019s valid, you\u2019ll get a <code>ReferenceError</code> instead of a silent <code>undefined</code> value.\u00a0Hooray!</p>\n<p>There\u2019s one other interesting quirk to <code>let</code> that I can\u2019t find explicitly documented.\u00a0Consider:</p>\n<table class=\"highlighttable\"><tr><td class=\"linenos\"/><td class=\"code\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span/><span class=\"kd\">let</span> <span class=\"nx\">closures</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[];</span>\n<span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"kd\">let</span> <span class=\"nx\">i</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">;</span> <span class=\"nx\">i</span> <span class=\"o\">&lt;</span> <span class=\"mi\">4</span><span class=\"p\">;</span> <span class=\"nx\">i</span><span class=\"o\">++</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"nx\">closures</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">push</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"kd\">function</span><span class=\"p\">()</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span> <span class=\"nx\">console</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">log</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">i</span><span class=\"p\">);</span> <span class=\"p\">});</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n<span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"kd\">let</span> <span class=\"nx\">j</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">;</span> <span class=\"nx\">j</span> <span class=\"o\">&lt;</span> <span class=\"nx\">closures</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">length</span><span class=\"p\">;</span> <span class=\"nx\">j</span><span class=\"o\">++</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"nx\">closures</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"nx\">j</span><span class=\"p\">]();</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</pre></div>\n</td></tr></table>\n\n<p>If this code had used <code>var i</code>, then it would print <code>4</code> four times, because the function-scoped <code>var i</code> means each closure is sharing the same <code>i</code>, whose final value is <code>4</code>.  With <code>let</code>, the output is <code>0 1 2 3</code>, as you might expect, because each run through the loop gets its own <code>i</code>.</p>\n<p>But wait, hang\u00a0on.</p>\n<p>The semantics of a C-style <code>for</code> are that the first expression is only evaluated <em>once</em>, at the very beginning.  So there\u2019s only one <code>let i</code>.  In fact, it makes no sense for each run through the loop to have a distinct <code>i</code>, because the whole idea of the loop is to <em>modify</em> <code>i</code> each time with <code>i++</code>.</p>\n<p>I assume this is simply a special case, since it\u2019s what everyone expects.  We expect it <em>so</em> much that I can\u2019t find anyone pointing out that the usual explanation for why it works makes no sense.  It has the interesting side effect that <code>for</code> no longer de-sugars to a <code>while</code> the same way as in C, since this will print all <code>4</code>s:</p>\n<table class=\"highlighttable\"><tr><td class=\"linenos\"/><td class=\"code\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span/><span class=\"nx\">closures</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[];</span>\n<span class=\"kd\">let</span> <span class=\"nx\">i</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"k\">while</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">i</span> <span class=\"o\">&lt;</span> <span class=\"mi\">4</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"nx\">closures</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">push</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"kd\">function</span><span class=\"p\">()</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span> <span class=\"nx\">console</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">log</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">i</span><span class=\"p\">);</span> <span class=\"p\">});</span>\n    <span class=\"nx\">i</span><span class=\"o\">++</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n<span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"kd\">let</span> <span class=\"nx\">j</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">;</span> <span class=\"nx\">j</span> <span class=\"o\">&lt;</span> <span class=\"nx\">closures</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">length</span><span class=\"p\">;</span> <span class=\"nx\">j</span><span class=\"o\">++</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"nx\">closures</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"nx\">j</span><span class=\"p\">]();</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</pre></div>\n</td></tr></table>\n\n<p>You\u2019d need to introduce an anonymous temporary state variable to recreate the same effect.  This isn\u2019t a problem \u2014 I\u2019m <em>glad</em> <code>let</code> works this way! \u2014 it just stands out to me as interesting.  Lua doesn\u2019t need a special case here, since it uses an iterator protocol that produces values rather than mutating a visible state variable, so there\u2019s no problem with having the loop variable be truly distinct on each run through the\u00a0loop.</p>\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes\"><span class=\"caps\">MDN</span> docs</a> \u2014 supported in Firefox 45, Chrome 42, Safari 9, Edge\u00a013</em></p>\n<p>Prototypical inheritance is pretty cool.  The way JavaScript presents it is a <em>little bit</em> opaque, unfortunately, which seems to confuse a lot of people.  JavaScript gives you enough functionality to make it work, and even makes it sound like a first-class feature with a property outright called <code>prototype</code>\u2026  but to actually <em>use</em> it, you have to do a bunch of weird stuff that doesn\u2019t much look like constructing an object or\u00a0type.</p>\n<p>The funny thing is, people with almost any background get along with Python just fine, and <em>Python uses prototypical inheritance</em>!  Nobody ever seems to notice this, because Python tucks it neatly behind a <code>class</code> block that works <em>enough</em> like a Java-style class.  (Python also handles inheritance without using the prototype, so it\u2019s a little different\u2026  but I digress.  Maybe in another\u00a0post.)</p>\n<p>The point is, there\u2019s nothing fundamentally <em>wrong</em> with how JavaScript handles objects; the ergonomics are just\u00a0terrible.</p>\n<p>Lo!  They finally added a <code>class</code> keyword.  Or, rather, they finally made the <code>class</code> keyword <em>do</em> something; it\u2019s been reserved this entire\u00a0time.</p>\n<table class=\"highlighttable\"><tr><td class=\"linenos\"><div class=\"linenodiv\"><pre> 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14</pre></div></td><td class=\"code\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span/><span class=\"kr\">class</span> <span class=\"nx\">Vector</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"nx\">constructor</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">x</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nx\">y</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"k\">this</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">x</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nx\">x</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n        <span class=\"k\">this</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">y</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nx\">y</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n\n    <span class=\"nx\">get</span> <span class=\"nx\">magnitude</span><span class=\"p\">()</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"nb\">Math</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">sqrt</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\">this</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">x</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span> <span class=\"k\">this</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">x</span> <span class=\"o\">+</span> <span class=\"k\">this</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">y</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span> <span class=\"k\">this</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">y</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n\n    <span class=\"nx\">dot</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">other</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"k\">this</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">x</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span> <span class=\"nx\">other</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">x</span> <span class=\"o\">+</span> <span class=\"k\">this</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">y</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span> <span class=\"nx\">other</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">y</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</pre></div>\n</td></tr></table>\n\n<p>This is all just sugar for existing features: creating a <code>Vector</code> function to act as the constructor, assigning a function to <code>Vector.prototype.dot</code>, and whatever it is you do to make a property.  (Oh, there are properties.  I\u2019ll get to that in a\u00a0bit.)</p>\n<p>The <code>class</code> block can be used as an expression, with or without a name.  It also supports prototypical inheritance with an <code>extends</code> clause and has a <code>super</code> pseudo-value for superclass\u00a0calls.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a <em>little</em> weird that the inside of the <code>class</code> block has its own special syntax, with <code>function</code> omitted and whatnot, but honestly you\u2019d have a hard time making a <code>class</code> block <em>without</em> special\u00a0syntax.</p>\n<p>One severe omission here is that you can\u2019t declare <em>values</em> inside the block, i.e. you can\u2019t just drop a <code>bar = 3;</code> in there if you want all your objects to share a default attribute.  The workaround is to just do <code>this.bar = 3;</code> inside the constructor, but I find that unsatisfying, since it defeats half the point of using\u00a0prototypes.</p>\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/defineProperty\"><span class=\"caps\">MDN</span> docs</a> \u2014 supported in Firefox 4, Chrome 5, <span class=\"caps\">IE</span> 9, Safari\u00a05.1</em></p>\n<p>JavaScript historically didn\u2019t have a way to intercept attribute access, which is a <em>travesty</em>.

It\u2019s actually\u2026  extremely\u00a0weird.</p>\n<p><code>symbol</code> is a new kind of <em>primitive</em> (like <code>number</code> and <code>string</code>), not an object (like, er, <code>Number</code> and <code>String</code>).  A symbol is created with <code>Symbol('foo')</code>.  No, not <code>new Symbol('foo')</code>; that throws a <code>TypeError</code>, for, uh, some\u00a0reason.</p>\n<p>The only point of a symbol is as a unique <em>key</em>.  You see, symbols have one very special property: they can be used as object keys, and <em>will not</em> be stringified.  Remember, only strings can be keys in JavaScript \u2014 even the indices of an array are, semantically speaking, still strings.  Symbols are a new exception to this\u00a0rule.</p>\n<p>Also, like other objects, two symbols don\u2019t compare equal to each other: <code>Symbol('foo') != Symbol('foo')</code>.</p>\n<p>The result is that symbols solve one of the problems that plagues most object systems, something I\u2019ve talked about before: <em>interfaces</em>.  Since an interface might be implemented by any arbitrary type, and any arbitrary type might want to implement any number of arbitrary interfaces, all the method names on an interface are effectively part of a single <strong>global</strong>\u00a0namespace.</p>\n<p>I think I need to take a moment to justify that.  If you have <code>IFoo</code> and <code>IBar</code>, both with a method called <code>method</code>, and you want to implement both on the same type\u2026  you have a problem.  Because most object systems consider \u201cinterface\u201d to mean \u201cI have a method called <code>method</code><span class=\"dquo\">\u201c</span>, with no way to say <em>which interface\u2019s</em> <code>method</code> you mean.  This is a hard problem to avoid, because <code>IFoo</code> and <code>IBar</code> might not even come from the same library.  Occasionally languages offer a clumsy way to \u201crename\u201d one method or the other, but the most common approach seems to be for interface designers to avoid names that sound \u201ctoo common\u201d.  You end up with redundant mouthfuls like <code>IFoo.foo_method</code>.</p>\n<p>This incredibly sucks, and the only languages I\u2019m aware of that avoid the problem are the <span class=\"caps\">ML</span> family and Rust.  In Rust, you define all the methods for a particular trait (interface) in a <em>separate block</em>, away from the type\u2019s \u201cown\u201d methods.  It\u2019s pretty slick.  You can still do <code>obj.method()</code>, and as long as there\u2019s only one <code>method</code> among all the available traits, you\u2019ll get that one.  If not, there\u2019s syntax for explicitly saying which trait you mean, which I can\u2019t remember because I\u2019ve never had to use\u00a0it.</p>\n<p>Symbols are JavaScript\u2019s answer to this problem.  If you want to define some interface, you can name its methods with <em>symbols</em>, which are guaranteed to be unique.  You just have to make sure you keep the symbol around somewhere accessible so other people can actually use it.  (Or\u2026\u00a0not?)</p>\n<p>The interesting thing is that JavaScript now has several of its own symbols built in, allowing user objects to implement features that were previously reserved for built-in types.  For example, you can use the <code>Symbol.hasInstance</code> symbol \u2014 which is simply where the language is storing an existing symbol and is <em>not</em> the same as <code>Symbol('hasInstance')</code>! \u2014 to override <code>instanceof</code>:</p>\n<table class=\"highlighttable\"><tr><td class=\"linenos\"/><td class=\"code\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span/><span class=\"c1\">// oh my god don't do this though</span>\n<span class=\"kr\">class</span> <span class=\"nx\">EvenNumber</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"kr\">static</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"nx\">Symbol</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">hasInstance</span><span class=\"p\">](</span><span class=\"nx\">obj</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"nx\">obj</span> <span class=\"o\">%</span> <span class=\"mi\">2</span> <span class=\"o\">==</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n<span class=\"nx\">console</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">log</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">2</span> <span class=\"k\">instanceof</span> <span class=\"nx\">EvenNumber</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>  <span class=\"c1\">// true</span>\n<span class=\"nx\">console</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">log</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">3</span> <span class=\"k\">instanceof</span> <span class=\"nx\">EvenNumber</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>  <span class=\"c1\">// false</span>\n</pre></div>\n</td></tr></table>\n\n<p>Oh, and those brackets around <code>Symbol.hasInstance</code> are a sort of reverse-quoting \u2014 they indicate an expression to use where the language would normally expect a literal identifier.  I think they work as object keys, too, and maybe some other\u00a0places.</p>\n<p>The equivalent in Python is to implement a method called <code>__instancecheck__</code>, a name which is not special in any way except that Python has reserved all method names of the form <code>__foo__</code>.  That\u2019s great for Python, but doesn\u2019t really help user code.  JavaScript has actually outclassed (ho ho) Python\u00a0here.</p>\n<p>Of course, <code>obj[BobNamespace.some_method]()</code> is not the prettiest way to call an interface method, so it\u2019s not <em>perfect</em>.  I imagine this would be best implemented in user code by exposing a polymorphic function, similar to how Python\u2019s <code>len(obj)</code> pretty much just calls <code>obj.__len__()</code>.</p>\n<p>I only bring this up because it\u2019s the plumbing behind one of the most incredible things in JavaScript that I didn\u2019t even know about until I started writing this post.  I\u2019m so excited oh my gosh.  Are you ready?\u00a0It\u2019s:</p>\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols\"><span class=\"caps\">MDN</span> docs</a> \u2014 supported in Firefox 27, Chrome 39, Safari 10; still experimental in\u00a0Edge</em></p>\n<p>Yes!

You give your object a method called <code>Symbol.iterator</code>, and that returns an\u00a0iterator.</p>\n<p>What\u2019s an iterator?  It\u2019s an object with a <code>next()</code> method that returns the next value and whether the iterator is\u00a0exhausted.</p>\n<p>Wait, wait, wait a second.  Hang on.  The method is called <code>next</code>?  Really?  You didn\u2019t go for <code>Symbol.next</code>?  Python 2 did exactly the same thing, then realized its mistake and changed it to <code>__next__</code> in Python 3.  Why did you do\u00a0this?</p>\n<p>Well, anyway.  My go-to test of an iterator protocol is how hard it is to write an equivalent to Python\u2019s <code>enumerate()</code>, which takes a list and iterates over its values <em>and</em> their indices.

You can also use generators to implement <code>Symbol.iterator</code>, much like using a generator for <code>__iter__</code> in\u00a0Python.</p>\n<p><code>function*</code> is a pretty strange choice of syntax, but whatever?  I guess it also lets them make <code>yield</code> only act as a keyword inside a generator, for ultimate backwards\u00a0compatibility.</p>\n<p>JavaScript generators support everything Python generators do: <code>yield*</code> yields every item from a subsequence, like Python\u2019s <code>yield from</code>; generators can return final values; you can pass values back into the generator if you iterate it by hand.  No, really, I wasn\u2019t kidding, <em>it\u2019s basically just copying Python</em>.  It\u2019s great.  You could now built <code>asyncio</code> in\u00a0JavaScript!</p>\n<p>In fact, <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function\">they did that</a>!  JavaScript now has <code>async</code> and <code>await</code>.  An <code>async function</code> returns a <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise\"><code>Promise</code></a>, which is also a built-in type now.\u00a0Amazing.</p>\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map\"><span class=\"caps\">MDN</span> docs for Map</a> \u2014 <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set\"><span class=\"caps\">MDN</span> docs for Set</a> \u2014 supported in Firefox 13, Chrome 38, <span class=\"caps\">IE</span> 11, Safari\u00a07.1</em></p>\n<p>I did <em>not</em> save the best for last.  This is much less exciting than generators.  But still\u00a0exciting.</p>\n<p>The only data structure in JavaScript is the object, a map where the keys are strings.  (Or now, also symbols, I guess.)  That means you can\u2019t readily use custom values as keys, nor simulate a set of arbitrary objects.  And you have to worry about people mucking with <code>Object.prototype</code>,\u00a0yikes.</p>\n<p>But now, there\u2019s <code>Map</code> and <code>Set</code>!\u00a0Wow.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, because JavaScript, <code>Map</code> couldn\u2019t use the indexing operators without losing the ability to have methods, so you have to use a boring old method-based <span class=\"caps\">API</span>.  But <code>Map</code> has convenient methods that plain objects don\u2019t, like <code>entries()</code> to iterate over pairs of keys and values.  In fact, you can use a map with <code>for..of</code> to get key/value pairs.  So that\u2019s\u00a0nice.</p>\n<p>Perhaps more interesting, there\u2019s also now a <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WeakMap\"><code>WeakMap</code></a> and <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WeakSet\"><code>WeakSet</code></a>, where the keys are weak references.  I don\u2019t think JavaScript had any way to do weak references before this, so that\u2019s pretty slick.  There\u2019s no obvious way to hold a weak <em>value</em>, but I guess you could substitute a <code>WeakSet</code> with only one\u00a0item.</p>\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals\"><span class=\"caps\">MDN</span> docs</a> \u2014 supported in Firefox 34, Chrome 41, Edge 12, Safari\u00a09</em></p>\n<p>Template literals are JavaScript\u2019s answer to string interpolation, which has historically been a huge pain in the ass because it doesn\u2019t even have string formatting in the standard\u00a0library.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re just strings delimited by backticks instead of quotes.

A lot of anger is in the air and everyone is united by one common goal \u2013 to get out of there as soon as possible!</p>\n<p>I did get used to it a little bit over time, but no matter how hard you try to stay calm, the madness just gets you. Especially at those moments when you train arrives at one of those very narrow platforms (most are like that at Penn) and another train right across is about to leave. At that point, the staircase (also VERY narrow, two people wide at best) becomes a real bottleneck, as people try to get out and get in at the same time. Trust me, it\u2019s magical\u2026</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bTjn5-Lij7E?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\">VIDEO</iframe></p>\n<h2>Why am I talking about Penn Station and what it has to do with website traffic?</h2>\n<p>Such an amazing questions, love you guys! \u00f0\u009f\u0099\u0082 If you think about it, website traffic is not so different from the real-world traffic. People just want to get to your site and view the content, same way as you want to get in and out of your train station.</p>\n<p>Under normal scenario (non-rush hour) everything works fine, only a few people go up and down \u201cthe stairs\u201d at the same time. But once you publish some awesome new story that goes viral, everything breaks loose.</p>\n<p>If you have just one server, or worse \u2013 a shared hosting (you may want to check out <a href=\"https://distinctplace.com/2017/09/06/shared-hosting-vs-vps-vs-cloud-services-way-go-day-28/\" target=\"_blank\">my post about different hosting types</a>), then you almost definitely have a very narrow staircase and people will start to queue up.</p>\n<p>Unlike Penn Station though, virtual people will not be waiting in the queue for too long. Here are few of the important points related to the website performance (compiled from a range of different sources):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The average shopper expects your site to load in less than two seconds\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>For every 100 milliseconds of delay, 1% of sales is lost (that was in 2008, I bet now the percent is even higher)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Over 75% of consumers left a given shopping site for a competitor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rather than sit and wait for a slow page to render</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>88% of consumers say they are less likely to return to a site after a bad experience</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Almost half say that they view the company itself in a negative light after a single bad experience with the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s website</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Mobile consumers are 2.5 times as likely to make purchases of $250 or more than those on desktop or laptop computers. Those are especially sensitive to website slowness.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Google uses website speed as one of the rankings factors</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But performance does not just affect e-commerce sites. A few months ago I had a client who runs a Viral news site. The business idea there was pretty simple \u2013 you publish some clickbaity content (local news in that case), drive a lot of traffic from Facebook or other sources and then make money by displaying ads to your visitors. Pretty standard and straightforward.</p>\n<p>His site was built on WordPress and it would crash every time it would get a decent amount of traffic. The most interesting part is that the client was not completely aware of the problem. Yes, he saw 504 error pages from time to time but didn\u2019t really know if other visitors were affected as well. In addition to that, the site was running on pretty expensive VPS, which should by definition <a href=\"https://distinctplace.com/2017/09/06/shared-hosting-vs-vps-vs-cloud-services-way-go-day-28/\" target=\"_blank\">significantly outperform shared hosting</a>, right?</p>\n<p>Well, not necessarily. See, website performance is a tricky subject. A LOT depends on the how the website was built, particular traffic patterns and specific business goals.</p>\n<p>The first thing that I usually do when I deal with website performance problems, before changing a single line of code, is gathering current metrics (idle and under load). You can imagine it like going to the doctor, where he takes a blood sample, measuring your heart rate and asks you to pee in the plastic cup.</p>\n<p>Same ideas apply to the websites, we just use different tools. For example for external monitoring I usually use <a href=\"https://www.pingdom.com\" target=\"_blank\">Pingdom</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://distinctplace-wp.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/10/pingdom_before_after_30days_uptime.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-936\" srcset=\"https://distinctplace-wp.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/10/pingdom_before_after_30days_uptime.jpg 640w, https://distinctplace-wp.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/10/pingdom_before_after_30days_uptime-286x300.jpg 286w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\"/></p>\n<p>That particular site had <strong>541 outages</strong> (or 2 days!) in one month and the owner was completely unaware!</p>\n<p>Pingdom basically pings your website every minute from different (configurable) locations in the world and displays all that information on the graph. There is nothing that you need to change on the website to add Pingdom to your site, it\u2019s purely external. Plus it notifies you (via SMS or email or both) if your site goes down or does not respond from particular locations.</p>\n<p>The next diagnostic service that I commonly use is <a href=\"https://newrelic.com\">Newrelic</a>. It\u2019s not cheap and not as easy to setup as Pingdom. Basically, it\u2019s a piece of software that needs to be installed on the server and normally will not work for sites running on shared hostings (as you don\u2019t have permissions to install anything).</p>\n<p>It\u2019s truly powerful if you configure and use it correctly. Newrelic allows you see website internals in real time! (think of it as a full-body MRI scanner for the web)</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://distinctplace-wp.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/10/php-apm-app-overview.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-937\" srcset=\"https://distinctplace-wp.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/10/php-apm-app-overview.png 640w, https://distinctplace-wp.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/10/php-apm-app-overview-300x179.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\"/></p>\n<h2>Some specific WordPress performance optimizations</h2>\n<p>What did I do for the Viral site I mentioned earlier? Well, the same thing basically. First I hooked it up to Pingdom which allowed me to identify the specific time of the day when the site was typically not available (down). Then I installed Newrelic on the client\u2019s VPS and observed the site under load.</p>\n<p>Those two steps gave me enough information to start changing stuff. In that particular case, I had to clean up a lot of the plugins and redo the whole theme. One of the major problems was related to ads, the main revenue generator for that website. Here is why.</p>\n<p>An old WordPress theme was not mobile optimized (not responsive), so the client purchased a plugin called WPTouch Pro which made his theme look good on mobile devices. The problem was hidden in the details (as usual). In order for this plugin to work properly, every website request had to reach WordPress (PHP + database), check if that\u2019s mobile device or not and then return modified HTML and CSS.</p>\n<p>Another major bottleneck was related to Ad Rotator plugin. It worked in the combination with WPTouch and suffered from the same issue \u2013 the plugin was doing some logic on the backend to determine which ads to show and where, which meant we had to accept and pass the whole request to WordPress.</p>\n<p>When we redid the theme, we dropped both WPTouch and AdRotator and moved ads logic to the frontend (rendered ads with JavaScript), then we added one of the free caching plugins (I think it was W3 Total Cache) that helped us to save whole WordPress posts and pages as HTML files.</p>\n<p>Then I installed the community version of <a href=\"https://nginx.org\" target=\"_blank\">Nginx</a>, a very lightweight and lightning fast web server that I highly recommend, and configured it so that for every incoming request we would first check if there was ready to use HTML file (cache) already and <strong>ONLY</strong> when it wasn\u2019t there I would let the request go to WordPress backend to generate and serve the page (then save in cache for next requests).</p>\n<p>By the way, the same caching technique works perfectly for the majority of content heavy websites with lots of pages that almost never change after initial publishing.</p>\n<p>After those few major changes, the client\u2019s website was alive again and was able to survive <strong>most</strong> of the traffic spikes. Why did I say most? Because it would still go down once or twice a week (instead of multiple times a day previously) during massive visitors influx (thousands of requests per second).</p>\n<p>Not going to lie, it was a pretty interesting problem which took me quite a bit of time to understand and fix. Turned out it was related to social counters and Ultimate Social Deux plugin.</p>\n<p>When we loaded the page from cache (super fast) it then did another client-side (AJAX) request to the server to get the current share counters for the post. Those requests had to go directly to WordPress and then database, get the data and return a response.</p>\n<p>Now you can easily imagine what happens when thousands of people load same Viral story at the same time \u2013 all of those requests had to fetch share counters from the database\u2026 Even though the response time for each request was fast, one server just couldn\u2019t handle the load. There are multiple solutions to this problem, we decided to go with the simples one and fetch counters only periodically (during main cache refresh). That solved the last major performance bottleneck.</p>\n<p>The client was so happy with our work  in the end that he even recorded a testimonial!</p>\n<p/>\n<p>Super cool right? \u00f0\u009f\u0099\u0082 I know. It\u2019s always nice to get some appreciation. Thanks, Leo!</p>\n<h2>Avoid premature optimizations!</h2>\n<p>Now, if you are dealing with only a handful of requests a day, you don\u2019t need to start removing your plugins after reading this post! Most likely your website will be just fine for a while. Only when you start getting some traction and the site starts to slow down or even die periodically, that\u2019s when you need to start considering deep optimizations. Focus on the business side and get that precious traffic first!</p>\n<p>Here we looked at one example of dealing with traffic volume. Sure, we can cache full HTML pages and survive substantial spikes that way, but unfortunately, this strategy also has some limits. More specifically, if we are dealing with very dynamic content (real-time stuff) or an e-commerce store, which needs to reflect up-to-date stock quantities after each order and show relevant products and recommendations, or just general personalized content (social network style), we can\u2019t just blindly cache the whole thing. That\u2019s when it becomes tricky\u2026</p>\n<p>For those scenarios, it might be perfectly reasonable to start scaling out (add more servers). Let\u2019s get back to our Penn Station example, as it\u2019s perfect for showing traffic handling strategies \u00f0\u009f\u0099\u0082</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jg3V9VxoFFs?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\">VIDEO</iframe></p>\n<p>See what is going on there? There are multiple lines and even stairs in the middle! You can think of each line as a server. The more lines we have, the more traffic we can handle (unless they have some shared bottleneck like the database\u2026).</p>\n<p>The other added benefit of having multiple servers is not having a single point of failure. Thanks to the beauty of cloud computing, I\u2019m fortunate enough to work with dynamic systems that involve not just one or ten, but thousands of virtual servers and trust me, they do fail a lot.</p>\n<p>Some servers are going through scheduled maintenance, some die for unexplained reasons, some are terminated (retired) by hosting provider. The point is, you need to prepare for disaster and having multiple servers is the first step in the right direction.</p>\n<p>I have another Penn Station picture that I took yesterday to illustrate my point:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://distinctplace-wp.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/10/C7A956C2-BA1B-47A7-ADB3-B406D01E303AL0001.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-938\" srcset=\"https://distinctplace-wp.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/10/C7A956C2-BA1B-47A7-ADB3-B406D01E303AL0001.jpg 640w, https://distinctplace-wp.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/10/C7A956C2-BA1B-47A7-ADB3-B406D01E303AL0001-300x225.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\"/></p>\n<p>As you can see, even though one line is currently shut down and undergoing repairs (for days!), people can still go up and down. The trick here is to schedule your maintenance at the right time (preferably off-peak hours). I hope one of the Penn Station officials will read this post and will make things better for all of us (if you don\u2019t forget to share it of course!)\u2026</p>\n<p>Get the idea? One server \u2013 whole site fails. Mulitple servers \u2013 no single point of failure. Great, great.</p>\n<p>Let me repeat one more time, if you are just starting out with your project, don\u2019t stress out about the concepts of single point of failures and stuff. I just wanted to show you what\u2019s possible.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s VERY easy to get into the technical nitty-gritty and waste a lot of time making the system more scalable and stable only to realize that your business idea sucks. It may give you a false sense of important activity, but in reality what you do is <a href=\"https://distinctplace.com/2017/08/22/day-13-writing-code-easy-launching-project-not/\" target=\"_blank\">premature optimization</a>. Don\u2019t do it, save yourself, run away.</p>\n<p>I meant to say feel free to ping me if your site is suffering from performance problems and don\u2019t forget to <a href=\"https://app.convertkit.com/landing_pages/250290\" target=\"_blank\">subscribe to my list</a>.

But the Venn diagram of programmers with that kind of savvy is not encouraging, so you may want to do some personal reflection before investing.<p>The good news is that if you want to get away from piecework web grunt stuff, you don&#x27;t need a degree (or even any formal education) to do that. If you apply yourself as seriously as you&#x27;d have to in school to practicing serious development, on personal projects, in specialized areas that are interesting to you, have some job market applicability, and involve more hardcore programming, you should be able to get yourself to a place where you can start interviewing for serious dev jobs.", "Going into HPC for the aerospace industry is more of a dream job, end game goal than something I&#x27;d get into quickly. But generally speaking I&#x27;m tired of doing small-scale work and want to become trained and knowledgeable in programming for large-scale systems where performance optimization is crucial. Whatever that entails. I&#x27;ve read short experiences of BS students getting internships at NVidia and that stuff inspires me.<p>Starting from a entry level salary rank is also actually a non-issue for me.

I&#x27;m talking $20-$25&#x2F;hr 1099 contract jobs here. In between I have no work, so it ends up like living paycheck to paycheck.<p>The main thing that has driven me towards considering the education option is that students get viewed in a different frame of mind by companies. Companies evaluate students and new grads by their potential.<p>People whose skills have gotten stale or incompatible need training, but training is almost exclusively given to new grads.

You can more easily accomplish these goals.<p>And in terms of opportunity cost remember just cause you made $20-25 the last few years doesn&#x27;t mean you will make that much over the next 4 years you would be going to school.  And if you are willing to work hard you could be making six figures in two years by staying in web or moving to mobile.<p>Also your ideas of training in the software world are way off base. I don&#x27;t know any devs who are any good from training.<p>For instance I did well getting a CS degree from a reputable state school, all my project and test scores were in the 90s.(UT Austin)  But I didn&#x27;t know how to program my way out of a paper bag.  I learned this the hard way, failing spectacularly at my first internship.  So I spent the next year working as hard as I could at learning how to develop.  It was all self-training and it made a world of difference.<p>You&#x27;ll find that all the best devs are voracious auto-didacts.  95% of all learning that happens in software is reading websites, books, and trial and error, not being sat down and trained how to do something.  And the 5% who rely on training are usually pretty shitty devs, because you can&#x27;t grow very quickly as a dev relying on other people to train you.  The spoon fed training usually isn&#x27;t that good, or complete.  To be honest I don&#x27;t know any devs who could even be generously called mediocre who relied on training&#x2F;teaching to be good.", "Space science is something that greatly interests me and I&#x27;d like to get employed in aerospace contributing to space exploration. HFT for fluid simulations is just one example, but there are several other ways I&#x27;m open to getting into.

Many internships already pay higher hourly wages than the $20-25 I have been getting paid.<p>I am very self-taught myself, but as you can see it hasn&#x27;t led me to a good career. Being the lone developer is actually a bad thing in the long run, and I learned the hard way that if you&#x27;re the smartest person in the team, you should move up to a different team or a different company. I learn better by working with someone that can kick my ass at software development most of the time. I don&#x27;t even know how to write unit tests!<p>But I&#x27;m also talking about the training done at big companies like Google.

I personally think it&#x27;s very dumb that 99% of the time, you must be currently enrolled in college in order to get an internship.

The goal of the test is to verify all behavior inside the \u201cblack box\u201d of the test boundaries by manipulating the inputs to the black box, and verifying that the correct output is produced by the black box for each set of inputs.</p><p name=\"161d\" id=\"161d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In a unit test the black box that is being tested is a function or class method. The goal is to test the behavior of that specific block of code in isolation. To understand how this works consider a basic user signup function:</p><figure name=\"251b\" id=\"251b\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"/><p name=\"d052\" id=\"d052\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">There are some obvious input and outputs to this function. The black box of the function accepts basic user signup details as parameter inputs, and it returns outputs such as the ID of the newly created user.</p><p name=\"e819\" id=\"e819\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">But there are also some less obvious inputs to this function. The function makes two external function calls: one call to a database to insert a record, and one call to a class that is responsible for password hashing and persistence. Under some conditions the database insert condition may return an error back into the user signup function. For example maybe there is a constraint that username must be unique and the database insert fails because the username is already taken. Or perhaps the password interface is a thin wrapper around an external password microservice, and behind the scenes it makes a network call. If there was a connectivity issue or the password service was overloaded and timed out it could cause that password function to return an error.</p><p name=\"bb4f\" id=\"bb4f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In order to fully test the behavior of the user signup function a unit test needs to do more than just pass different user signup parameters. It also needs to reproduce the inputs that external dependencies may introduce in order to verify that this function behaves appropriately based on those inputs as well. This especially important when it comes to testing the error handling of a function.</p><h3 name=\"4f3c\" id=\"4f3c\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Test Stubs &amp;\u00a0Mocks</h3><p name=\"1e44\" id=\"1e44\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">In order to reproduce input conditions that come from side effects it is necessary to implement function stubs, also called mocks. This can be done using dependency injection or method swizzling. Both techniques allow a test framework to execute a tested function while ensuring that any calls out to an underlying function dependency are redirected to a different function that is a stub used for testing:</p><figure name=\"1098\" id=\"1098\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"/><p name=\"eb18\" id=\"eb18\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">The function stub can be used to do a number of different things:</p><ul class=\"postList\"><li name=\"8ac2\" id=\"8ac2\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">The stub can be setup to do nothing. This is a way to speed up the execution of a particular unit test by disabling the side effects of the tested function, especially if those side effects will be tested by another dedicated unit test that runs later.</li><li name=\"90e7\" id=\"90e7\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">The stub can be used to return arbitrary values to simulate responses from external functions. This is useful for testing function behavior under conditions that may be hard to replicate, such as code that handles error conditions that rarely occur or are hard to reproduce.</li><li name=\"25ee\" id=\"25ee\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">The stub can be used to capture parameters that the function attempted to pass to an external function, or just record the fact that the call was made to an external function. This allows the unit test to verify expectations about what external calls the function should have attempted to make, and what parameters should have been passed.</li></ul><p name=\"e5f8\" id=\"e5f8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">Having good stubs is essential for unit testing a distributed system because it allows unit tests to be run while disabling or simulating any external interactions with other services. Here is a list of tools that can be used to help you develop stubs in various runtime languages:</p><h4 name=\"b6a8\" id=\"b6a8\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">Node.js / JavaScript</h4><ul class=\"postList\"><li name=\"db08\" id=\"db08\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--h4\"><a href=\"http://sinonjs.org/\" data-href=\"http://sinonjs.org/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--li-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">sinon.js</a> (Supplies both stub and spy functionality that makes it easy to build test assertions)</li><li name=\"427c\" id=\"427c\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\"><a href=\"https://github.com/testdouble/testdouble.js\" data-href=\"https://github.com/testdouble/testdouble.js\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--li-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">testdouble.js</a> (Stub generator with a focus on expressive object oriented API)</li><li name=\"0c07\" id=\"0c07\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\"><a href=\"https://github.com/node-nock/nock\" data-href=\"https://github.com/node-nock/nock\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--li-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">nock</a> (A library that is focused on making it easy to stub out HTTP request behavior)</li></ul><h4 name=\"3a84\" id=\"3a84\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--li\">Python</h4><h4 name=\"d1e4\" id=\"d1e4\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--li\">Go</h4><h4 name=\"4d24\" id=\"4d24\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--li\">Java</h4><p name=\"2286\" id=\"2286\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">If you have more suggestions for test stub / mock frameworks to add to this list please comment below this article, and I\u2019ll add on to the list.</p><h3 name=\"5486\" id=\"5486\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Unit Test\u00a0Workflow</h3><p name=\"165f\" id=\"165f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">The goal of unit tests is to give developers a way to rapidly verify the behavior of their code in between edits. Because the unit test are just making function calls to exercise logic flows while all external dependencies are stubbed out it is common to be able to execute and verify thousands of unit tests within a few seconds. The speed of these tests allows developers to run tests as part of their coding workflow, either directly integrated into their IDE, or by having a terminal to the side of their editor. By frequently rerunning the unit tests while editing code developers are able to identify potential issues before they even finish writing the code.</p><p name=\"c056\" id=\"c056\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Once developers are in the habit of running and rerunning tests as they write code it is a small step up to test driven development. In this strategy developers actually write new test expectations prior to writing a new feature. The new test fails initially, until the new feature is added. The full functionality of the feature is built up as a process of repeatedly adding a failing test, then adding new feature code, then rerunning the failing test to verify that it now passes.</p><p name=\"24ba\" id=\"24ba\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The role of unit tests goes beyond code development. They should also be integrated into the code merge process. Github supports status checks that work with all mainstream continuous integration servers. A common process is to make the \u201cmaster\u201d branch of your git repository a protected branch. Developers can\u2019t commit directly to the master branch. Instead they make working commits on a feature branch forked from master. When it comes time to merge the feature branch back into the master branch Github can require that status checks pass before code can be merged.</p><p name=\"af1f\" id=\"af1f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The status checks are hooked up to providers such as <a href=\"https://jenkins.io/\" data-href=\"https://jenkins.io/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jenkins</a>, <a href=\"https://circleci.com/\" data-href=\"https://circleci.com/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CircleCI</a>, or <a href=\"https://travis-ci.org/\" data-href=\"https://travis-ci.org/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">TravisCI</a>, which take the code from that branch and run unit tests against it. If status checks succeed then merging is enabled, but if status checks fail Github will not allow the failing branch to be merged.</p></div></div></body></html>"}, "15429035": {"score": 1, "comments": [], "time": "2017-10-08 20:20:55", "url": "https://aiimpacts.org/2016-expert-survey-on-progress-in-ai/", "text": "<body id=\"readabilityBody\">&#13;\n<center><h1>403 Forbidden</h1></center>&#13;\n<hr/><center>nginx</center>&#13;\n</body>&#13;\n"}, "15431246": {"score": 2, "comments": [], "time": "2017-10-09 05:42:12", "url": "https://thenextweb.com/artificial-intelligence/2017/10/06/1082787/", "text": "<html><body><div><div class=\"post-body fb-quotable u-m-3\">\n                            <p>Sometimes you run into an idea that seems so ridiculous, you simply have to know more about it \u2013 even if it\u2019s just to scoff at idiocy.

The description read: \u2018A smart machine that trains crows to pick up cigarette butts from the street.\u2019 Right, I thought.</p>\n<p>But then I thought more.</p>\n<p>I thought of this:</p>\n<p/>\n<p>And this:</p>\n<p/>\n<p>And opened the link.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.crowdedcities.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Crowded Cities</a> started more or less on a lark. Industrial designers Ruben van der Vleuten and Bob Spikman came up with the idea when they noticed the tremendous amount of cigarette butts around them in a park in Amsterdam \u2013 and started theorizing a solution.</p>\n<p>The most obvious answer was robots, but neither of them thought it would be very elegant to pull off the complex programming needed to vacuum up butts in-between bike wheels and other city nooks and crannies. So they turned their attention to birds.</p>\n<p>\u201cFirst we thought of pigeons,\u201d Ruben tells me in their design studio in the center of Amsterdam, \u201cwhich would have been great because there are so many of them in cities.\u201d Unfortunately, a quick search revealed that there was not much known about the intelligence of pigeons, and that training them would be hard.</p>\n<p>Luckily there\u2019s another type of bird that loves living near humans and possesses the ability to problem-solve and learn autonomously. I can try to stretch this, but you know I\u2019m talking about crows.</p>\n<p>For those who are not aware of the wonderful intelligence the corvid family possesses: I envy you. You have an incredible <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWXe7Js6GnI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">YouTube journey</a> ahead of you.</p>\n<p>For those marginally aware: Most of what you\u2019ve heard is true. Crows are currently ranked among the most intelligent species on the planet, with an encephalization quotient (fancy word for smarts) equal to that of chimpanzees.</p>\n<p>Thanks to their understanding of causality, crows can conceptualize, create, and use tools. They play, learn from each other, and can manipulate humans into helping them out. Some types of crows can even count. No joke.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen we bumped into this project by a guy named Joshua Klein, and everything clicked,\u201d Ruben tells me.</p>\n<figure class=\"post-image post-mediaBleed aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1082799 lazy\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" data-src=\"https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/10/kit_lg.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/10/kit_lg.jpg 1024w, https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/10/kit_lg-280x210.jpg 280w, https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/10/kit_lg-360x270.jpg 360w, https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/10/kit_lg-180x135.jpg 180w, https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/10/kit_lg-796x597.jpg 796w, https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/10/kit_lg-368x276.jpg 368w, https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/10/kit_lg-736x552.jpg 736w, https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/10/kit_lg-632x474.jpg 632w, https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/10/kit_lg-536x402.jpg 536w\"/><figcaption>Credit: <a href=\"http://www.thecrowbox.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The Crow Box</a></figcaption><figcaption><a href=\"#\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fthenextweb.com%2Fartificial-intelligence%2F2017%2F10%2F06%2F1082787%2F&amp;via=thenextweb&amp;related=thenextweb&amp;text=Check out this picture on: The Crow Box by Joshua Klein\" data-title=\"Share The Crow Box by Joshua Klein on Twitter\" data-width=\"685\" data-height=\"500\" class=\"post-image-share popitup\" title=\"Share The Crow Box by Joshua Klein on Twitter\"><i class=\"icon icon--inline icon--twitter--dark\"/></a>The Crow Box by Joshua Klein</figcaption></figure><p>Joshua Klein is creator of the <a href=\"http://www.thecrowbox.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Crow Box</a>, an open source project that\u2019s basically a vending machine for crows.

A problem that could be addressed with the Crow Bar.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat you want is that the crows associate food with butts,\u201d Ruben explains. To achieve this, the machine follows Klein\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.josh.is/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/crows_JoshKlein.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">tried and simple four-step process</a> to train crows.</p>\n<p>The first step presents the crow with food and a butt on a tray in the machine. The food is always there, next to the butt, so the crow learns to come back for more.</p>\n<p>The second step takes away the food, and only drops it just after the crow arrives. \u201cSo the crow gets used to the machine doing things,\u201d Bob says.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe third step is crucial,\u201d they tell me. In this step, the food is completely removed, leaving only the butt on the tray. The crow, used to getting food only for being there, will start to nose (beak?) around, eventually knocking the butt off the tray into the butt receptacle. The food drops when that happens.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"post-image post-mediaBleed aligncenter\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1082801 lazy\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1093px) 100vw, 1093px\" data-src=\"https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/10/IMG_20170622_203801.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/10/IMG_20170622_203801.jpg 1093w, https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/10/IMG_20170622_203801-280x210.jpg 280w, https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/10/IMG_20170622_203801-360x270.jpg 360w, https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/10/IMG_20170622_203801-180x135.jpg 180w, https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/10/IMG_20170622_203801-796x597.jpg 796w, https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/10/IMG_20170622_203801-368x276.jpg 368w, https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/10/IMG_20170622_203801-736x552.jpg 736w, https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/10/IMG_20170622_203801-1044x783.jpg 1044w, https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/10/IMG_20170622_203801-632x474.jpg 632w, https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/10/IMG_20170622_203801-536x402.jpg 536w\"/></figure></p>\n<p>This step is repeated until the crow learns to associate dropping the butt with getting food.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe fourth step is the only step where humans are involved.

And presto; A beautiful machine-animal symbiosis to help out humans with a behavioral problem that\u2019s poisoning the environment.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut what about the crows?\u201d you ask, as I did too. \u201cWon\u2019t they be harmed by picking up our disgusting toxic garbage with \u2013 essentially \u2013 their mouths?\u201d</p>\n<p>Well, maybe, but the designer duo is pragmatic about this. \u201cThe effect is on nature is huge, and we feel that a few crows are a small price to pay. Moreover, the short contact with the butt ensures the effect is minimal,\u201d Bob assures me. \u201cWe can regulate the machine to limit the number of crows that are trained. But indeed, we still need to do extensive research on this, because if the effects are found out to be bad for crows we have to look for another solution.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s another species they\u2019re planning to train with their project. Us. In the end, it\u2019s a flaw in human behavior that\u2019s causing the problem. \u201cIt\u2019s also about starting a discussion,\u201d Ruben says. \u201cWhen we tell people about this project, and they realize how large the problem is, it changes their behavior.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe hope a concept like this can create a lot of awareness. Most people somehow don\u2019t really think of throwing their cigarettes the same way they\u2019d think of a plastic candy wrapper.\u201d Which is weird.</p>\n<p>Bob and Ruben still have a ways to go with their machine, before any of the above becomes a reality.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"post-image post-mediaBleed aligncenter\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1082802 lazy\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1093px) 100vw, 1093px\" data-src=\"https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/10/IMG_20170903_165828.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/10/IMG_20170903_165828.jpg 1093w, https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/10/IMG_20170903_165828-280x210.jpg 280w, https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/10/IMG_20170903_165828-360x270.jpg 360w, https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/10/IMG_20170903_165828-180x135.jpg 180w, https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/10/IMG_20170903_165828-796x597.jpg 796w, https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/10/IMG_20170903_165828-368x276.jpg 368w, https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/10/IMG_20170903_165828-736x552.jpg 736w, https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/10/IMG_20170903_165828-1044x783.jpg 1044w, https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/10/IMG_20170903_165828-632x474.jpg 632w, https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/10/IMG_20170903_165828-536x402.jpg 536w\"/></figure></p>\n<p>\u201cWe have all parts working separately, but not together yet,\u201d they tell me, pulling bits and pieces of electronics out of a big plastic box. Ruben shows me the crude butt dispenser needed for the first steps of the training, and Bob talks about the difficulty of training machine learning software to tell a cigarette butt apart from a lollipop stick.</p>\n<p>To able to complete the project, the pair is currently looking for ways to fund a serious experiment. I ask them if they\u2019d already considered CROWdfunding, and thoroughly hate myself for it.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s really a first test, and if it turns out it doesn\u2019t work, we\u2019d feel very responsible toward lots of people,\u201d Bob says, ignoring my idiot joke. \u201cIt\u2019s also not really known how long it takes to train wild crows. We\u2019ll just have to test.\u201d</p>\n<p>With fingers crossed, I reached out to <a href=\"http://sefs.washington.edu/research.acl/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">professor John Marzluff</a>, a world-renown corvid expert who has written multiple books on the species, to ask if he saw anything in the project.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am sure crows could learn to do this. They are quick studies when rewarded for their actions. I\u2019ve heard stories of crows picking up cigarettes elsewhere and have wondered if it had a purpose. Pet crows often steal their owners\u2019 cigs, and Indian house crows have been photographed with cigs in their beaks. But why? Maybe just trying potential food sources they see us put in our mouths? Or perhaps they are using the spent filters as insecticides for their nests as some other birds have been found to do? So, yes they could do it,\u201d he wrote back.</p>\n<p>Marzluff was quick to point out the ethical implications as well though: \u201cIt is equally important to ask, should we enslave crows to do our dirty work for us? To me the answer to that question is NO. Crows have lives of their own to live and we should just marvel at their lives, rather than try to coerce them into working for us. It would be more ethical to devise a machine to pick up butts, create biodegradable butts, or better yet, train our smoking conspecifics to pick up after themselves.\u201d</p>\n<p>The resounding, capitalized \u2018NO\u2019 in professor Marzluff answer only adds to the brilliance of the idea, in my opinion.</p>\n<p>The project doesn\u2019t only look at nature for solutions to purely human problems, pitting millions of years of evolution against our puny attempts, it also combines the beauty of our most advanced technology with the strengths of some of the smartest animals on earth. And to boot, it\u2019s not only a physical solution, it\u2019s a psychological one as well.</p>\n<p>Pissed off people make for great conduits of ideas, and even though the upper layer \u2013 exploiting crows \u2013 might be perceived as problematic, it\u2019s a great way to get people talking about the underlying layer: Our own problems.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s glorious. An idea for a machine that trains crows to solve a waste problem we\u2019re creating, ends up training us to be more conscious of the root of the problem, thus hopefully putting a dent in the production of waste, and eliminating the need for the idea itself.</p>\n<p>In other words: The machine doesn\u2019t only train crows. It trains humans.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"post-image post-mediaBleed aligncenter\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1082806 lazy\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1093px) 100vw, 1093px\" data-src=\"https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/10/Super-brain.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/10/Super-brain.jpg 1093w, https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/10/Super-brain-280x210.jpg 280w, https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/10/Super-brain-360x270.jpg 360w, https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/10/Super-brain-180x135.jpg 180w, https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/10/Super-brain-796x597.jpg 796w, https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/10/Super-brain-368x276.jpg 368w, https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/10/Super-brain-736x552.jpg 736w, https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/10/Super-brain-1044x783.jpg 1044w, https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/10/Super-brain-632x474.jpg 632w, https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/10/Super-brain-536x402.jpg 536w\"/></figure></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p class=\"post-article-read-next\">\n    <b>Read next:</b>\n    <a class=\"gtm-article-read-next\" data-event-category=\"Article\" data-event-action=\"Next post\" data-event-label=\"\" data-event-non-interaction=\"true\" href=\"https://thenextweb.com/money/2017/10/06/new-blockchain-research-platform-helps-investors-to-avoid-ico-scams/\">\n        New blockchain research platform helps investors to avoid ICO scams    </a>\n</p>\n\n\n                            \n\n                        </div>\n\n                        \n</div></body></html>"}, "15429201": {"score": 3, "comments": [], "time": "2017-10-08 21:02:00", "url": null, "text": "What&#x27;s a contemporary (state of the art) way of authenticating users on the web?

Selecting only on one trait means that most of the genotype information is being ignored; at best, this is a lost opportunity, and at worst, it is harmful - in the very long run (dozens of generations), selection only on one trait, particularly in a small breeding population, will have <q>unintended consequences</q> like greater disease rates, shorter lifespans, etc (see Falconer 1960\u00e2\u0080\u0099s <em>Introduction to Quantitative Genetics</em>, <a href=\"https://archive.org/stream/introductiontoq00falc#page/312/mode/2up\">Ch. 19 <q>Correlated Characters</q></a>).</p>\n<p>This is why animal breeders do not select purely on a single valuable trait like egglaying rate but on an index of many traits, from maturity speed to disease resistance to lifespan; when breeding is done out of ignorance or with regard only to a few traits, one may wind up with problematic breeds like some purebred dog breeds which have serious health issues due to inbreeding, small founding populations, no selection against negative mutations popping up, and variants which increase the selected trait at the expense of another trait.</p>\n<p>In our case, a weak polygenic score can be strengthened by better GWASes, but it can also be combined with other polygenic scores to do selection on multiple traits by summing the scores per embryo and taking the maximum. This can be done almost for free, since if one did sequencing on a comprehensive SNP array chip to compute 1 polygenic score, one probably has all the information needed. (Indeed, you could see selection on a single trait as a multiple selection procedure where all traits\u00e2\u0080\u0099 values are implausibly set to 0 except for 1 trait.) In reality, while some traits are of much more value than others, there are few traits with <em>no</em> value at all; an embryo which scores mediocrely on our primary trait may still have many other advantages which more than compensate, so why not check? (It is a general principle that more information is better than less.) Intelligence is valuable, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also valuable to live a long time, have less risk for schizophrenia, lower BMI, be happier, and so on.</p>\n<p>A quick demonstration of the possible gain is to imagine the total of 1 normal deviate (<math display=\"inline\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mstyle mathvariant=\"script\"><mi>\u00f0\u009d\u0092\u00a9</mi></mstyle><mo stretchy=\"false\" form=\"prefix\">(</mo><mn>0</mn><mo>,</mo><mn>1</mn><mo stretchy=\"false\" form=\"postfix\">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\mathcal{N}(0,1)</annotation></semantics></math>) vs picking the most extreme out of several normal deviates. With 1 deviate, our average extreme is 0, and most of the time will be \u00c2\u00b11SD. But if we can pick out of batches of 10, we can generally get +1.53SD:</p>\n<p>What if we have 4 different scores (with two downweighted substantially to reflect that they are less valuable)? We get 0.23SD for free:</p>\n<p>This is just like selecting among multiple embryos: the more we have to pick from, the better the chance one will be particularly good. So in selecting embryos, we want to compute multiple polygenic scores for each embryo, weight them by the overall value of that trait, sum them to get a total score for each embryo, then select the best embryo for implantation.</p>\n<p>Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s imagine a US example but with 3 traits now, IQ and 2 we consider to be roughly half as valuable as IQ, but which have better polygenic scores available of 60% and 5%. What sort of gain can we expect above our starting point?</p>\n<p>So we double our gains by considering 3 traits instead of 1.</p>\n<section id=\"multiple-selection-on-genetically-correlated-traits\" class=\"level4\">\n<h4>Multiple selection on genetically correlated traits</h4>\n<p>In single selection, the embryo selected is picked from the batch solely based on its polygenic score on 1 trait, even if the gain is small and some of the other embryos have large genetic advantages on other, almost as important, traits. In multiple selection, we take the maximum from the embryos based on all the scores summed together, allowing for excellence on 1 trait or general high quality on a few other traits.</p>\n<p>What sort of advantage do we expect? It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not as simple as generating some random numbers independently from a distribution and then summing them, because the actual genetic scores will turn out to be intercorrelated: a high polygenic score for intelligence will also tend to lower the BMI polygenic score, and a high BMI polygenic score will increase the childhood obesity polygenic score or the smoking polygenic score because they genetically overlap on the same SNPs. In fact, all traits will tend to be a little (or a lot) genetically correlated. If we ignore this, we may badly over or underestimate the advantage of multiple selection: the advantage of selection on a good trait may be partially negated if it drags in a bad trait, or the advantage may be amplified if it comes with other good traits.</p>\n<p>We need a dataset giving the pairwise genetic correlations of a lot of important traits, and then we can generate hypothetical multivariate sets of polygenic scores which follow what the real-world distribution of polygenic scores would look like, and <em>then</em> we can sum them up, maximize, and see what sort of gain we have.</p>\n<p>A specific genetic correlation can be estimated from twin studies, or as part of GWAS studies using an algorithm like GCTA or LD score regression. LD score regression has the notable advantage of being usable on solely the polygenic scores for individual traits released by GWASes, without requiring the same subjects to be phenotyped or access to subject-level data, and computationally tractable; hence it is possible to collect various publicly released polygenic scores for any traits and calculate the correlations for all pairs of traits.</p>\n<p>This has been done by done by <a href=\"http://ldsc.broadinstitute.org/\">LD Hub</a> (described in <a href=\"http://biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2016/05/03/051094.full.pdf\" title=\"LD Hub: a centralized database and web interface to perform LD score regression that maximizes the potential of summary level GWAS data for SNP heritability and genetic correlation analysis\">Zheng et al 2016</a>), which provides a web interface to an implementation of LD score regression and &gt;100 public polygenic scores which are now also available for estimating SNP heritability or genetic correlations. Zheng et al 2016 describes the initial correlation matrix for 49 traits, a number which are of practical interest in multiple selection; <a href=\"http://ldsc.broadinstitute.org/static/media/LD-Hub_genetic_correlation_49x49.xlsx\">the spreadsheet</a> can be downloaded, saved as CSV, and the first lines edited to provide a usable file in R.</p>\n<p>Several of the traits are redundant or overlapping: it is scientifically useful to know that height as measured in one study is the same thing as measured in a different study (implying that the relevant genetics in the two populations are the same, and that the phenotype data was collected in a similar manner, which is something you might take for granted for a trait like height, but would be in considerable doubt for mental illnesses), but we really don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need 4 slightly different traits related to tobacco use or ~9 traits about obesity.

For a multiple selection version, we can consider a correlation matrix for 34 traits in which every trait is uncorrelated, with the same settings (higher=better, 0.33 heritability, 10 half-related siblings): with more traits to sum, the best choice becomes much better, giving us +3.644SDs on an overall index. Finally, what if we populate the correlation matrix with genetic correlations like those in the LD Hub dataset (ignoring the issues of trait-specific heritabilities, losses/gains, and available polygenic scores)? Do we get less or more than 3.644SD because traits cancel out?

Adding the real trait heritabilities, we see that the gains to multiple selection remain large compared to single selection (2.9 or 3.3SDs vs 0.6SDs), and that the genetic correlations do <em>not</em> substantially reduce gains to multiple selection but in fact benefits multiple selection by adding +0.35SD.</p>\n<p>Continuing onward: if multiple selection is helpful, what sort of net benefit to selection would we get after assigning some reasonable costs to each trait &amp; using current polygenic scores? (One intriguing possibility I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t cover here: fertility is highly heritable, so one could select for greater fertility; combined with selection on other traits, could this eventually eliminate dysgenic trends at their source?)</p>\n<p>Coming up with that information for 34 traits in the same detail as I have for intelligence would be extremely challenging, so I will settle for some quicker and dirtier estimates; in cases where the causal impact is not clear or I cannot find reasonably reliable cost estimates, I will simply drop the trait (which will be conservative and underestimate possible gains from multiple selection).

Acquire a corpse. No, no hints about where or how. You\u2019re on your own there.</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\">Step 2. Cut away as much flesh as you can. Watch the joints and ligaments\u2014you need those intact.</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\">Step 3. Acquire a body-length box, with holes in the walls. Place the bones inside, and cover with quicklime (used for centuries in agriculture, warfare, and cemeteries, and now <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071R6SRHV/ref=asc_df_B071R6SRHV5197417/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;creative=395033&amp;creativeASIN=B071R6SRHV&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=198107334619&amp;hvpos=1o1&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=5786039409177638114&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9004351&amp;hvtargid=pla-350801413911\">available online</a>). Sprinkle with water and wait a week. Presumably, leave the box someplace where no one will accidentally open it.</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\">Step 4. Locate a stream or other body of running water in which to place the box. Give it a week, to allow the stream wash away the now loose and decaying flesh.</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\">Step 5. Clean off any leftover flesh, and leave the skeleton to dry in the sun. The ligaments should keep the bones together.</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\">There\u2014your very own human skeleton.</p>\n<figure class=\" contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"http://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/46674/image.jpg\" alt=\"An 1833 study of bones.\" data-kind=\"article-image\" id=\"article-image-46674\"/><figcaption class=\"caption structured-caption noskim\">An 1833 study of bones. <a class=\"caption-credit\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Skeletons_from_%22Anatomical_studies_of_bones...%22,_J._Flaxman_Wellcome_L0011906.jpg\">Wellcome Images</a></figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\">If you find this set of instructions foul, so did Andreas Vesalius, the 16th-century author from whom they\u2019re derived. Vesalius was a hotshot Renaissance scientist with a talent for self-promotion. He was young, cocky, and skeptical of the medical establishment, which was still reliant on ancient Greek medical work that was already more than a millennium old at the time. In Vesalius\u2019s opinion, skeleton-making was \u201ctime-consuming, dirty, and difficult,\u201d according to Oregon State University historian <a href=\"https://anitaguerrini.com\">Anita Guerrini</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\">He preferred a different strategy for revealing human skeletal anatomy. First, boil the body in a \u201ccapacious cauldron,\u201d then skim away the fat and clean the boiled flesh from the bones. That way, you could actually see the joints, instead of leaving them hidden behind blackened ligaments.</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\">\u201cNow most of the skeletons used in medical schools are plastic, but the ones that were used a couple hundred years ago\u2014they were all people,\u201d says Guerrini. For centuries human skeletons have been bought and sold, though it\u2019s rare for a commodity to have once been part of a person. But despite the long practice of hanging human bones in museums and academic institutions, \u201cwe really don\u2019t have a good history of skeletons,\u201d says Guerrini. After noticing how overlooked they had been, she began investigating the history and iconography of skeletons\u2014how they were they used, how they were made, and how that knowledge was passed down through generations of scientists. Vesalius\u2019s technique was one among many proposed strategies for creating a pristine set of human bones.</p>\n<figure class=\" contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption  image-outlined\" src=\"http://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/46675/image.jpg\" alt=\"Skeleton of Richard Helain, 1493.\" data-kind=\"article-image\" id=\"article-image-46675\"/><figcaption class=\"caption structured-caption noskim\">Skeleton of Richard Helain, 1493. <a class=\"caption-credit\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Skeleton_of_Richard_Helain,_1493._Wellcome_M0000411.jpg\">Wellcome Images</a></figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\">Vesalius\u2019s description is the oldest-known set of such instructions, but by the 1540s, the practice had been around for some time, perhaps going as far back as the 1300s, as Guerrini recounted in <a href=\"http://heymancenter.org/events/explorations-in-the-medical-humanities/\">a talk at Columbia University</a> this past September. One 14th-century scientist, for instance, mentions \u201cmaking an anatomy\u201d from fleshless bones.</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\">Vesalius became a professor in Padua, as chief of surgery and anatomy, in 1537, when he was just 23 years old, and he wrote <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_humani_corporis_fabrica\"><em>De humani corporis fabrica</em></a> (<em>On the Fabric of the Human Body</em>)<em>, </em>which contains the skeleton instructions, before he turned 30. \u201cHe was brilliant, and he was very brash,\u201d says Guerrini. His book, unusually, had a portrait of himself on the title page, and another on the frontispiece. While his older colleagues deferred to the medical works of Galen, the Greek physician who lived in the 2nd century, Vesalius preferred direct observation of the human body. He taught using dissection and seemed to have no qualms about using human remains. \u201cWith characteristic macabre whimsy he recommended posing the skeleton with a scythe, or a pike, or a javelin, and suggested stringing the ear bones onto a nerve to make a necklace,\u201d Guerrini said in her talk.</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\">He didn\u2019t care much about the aesthetics of the bones themselves, though. The boil-and-carve strategy he advocated for would have left the bones mottled and brown. As skeletons became more popular as objects of display and learning, their appearance became more important.</p>\n<figure class=\" contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"http://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/46678/image.jpg\" alt=\"An illustration of a skeleton from Vesalius's &lt;em&gt;De humani corporis fabrica&lt;/em&gt;. \" data-kind=\"article-image\" id=\"article-image-46678\"/><figcaption class=\"caption structured-caption noskim\">An illustration of a skeleton from Vesalius\u2019s <em>De humani corporis fabrica</em>. <a class=\"caption-credit\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"hhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Vesalius_Fabrica_p163.jpg\">Public domain</a></figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\">They remained rare objects, though, until the 17th century, when the new science of osteology, the study of bones, increased their use in anatomical study. By the middle of that century, skeletons, both human and animal, started showing up in the catalogues of natural history collections and cabinets of curiosities, such as the elaborate, skeleton-filled <a href=\"http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/ruysch-bidloo-anatomy-dutch-rivarly-17th-century\">dioramas built by Dutch anatomist Frederik Ruysch</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\">Soon students of both art and anatomy were expected to study human skeletons as part of their training, and the public grew curious as well. By the 1660s, there was a market for them in Europe. By the 18th century, displaying human skeletons became trendy. Guerrini found a 1716 advertisement for \u201c<a href=\"https://anitaguerrini.com/2015/10/30/on-slates-the-vault-blog-the-moving-skeleton/\">The Moving Skeleton</a>,\u201d a public attraction \u201cwhich by a mechanical projection performs several very strange and surprising actions, also groans like a dying person, smoaks[sic] a Pipe of Tobacco, and blows the Candle out, as naturally as if alive.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\">By this time, anatomists wanted to produce clean, white bones. One physician made sure to leave his bones out for months to bleach in the sun. Another eschewed boiling bones and instead left corpses to rot in water, changed periodically. This \u201cmaceration\u201d technique required pulling softened flesh away from the bones and would have required a steely constitution. But the demand for skeletons was high enough that more people were taking on this job: In the early 18th century, one surgeon offered a course in skeleton-making.</p>\n<figure class=\" contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"http://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/46676/image.jpg\" alt=\"A skeleton illustration from the work of 17th-century Dutch anatomist Govert Bidloo. \" data-kind=\"article-image\" id=\"article-image-46676\"/><figcaption class=\"caption structured-caption noskim\">A skeleton illustration from the work of 17th-century Dutch anatomist Govert Bidloo. <a class=\"caption-credit\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/40/Bidloo_Ontleding_1690_88.jpg\">National Library of Medicine/Public domain</a></figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\">While researching this history, Guerrini found that, some time in the 200 years after Vesalius, anatomists became more circumspect about their habit of stripping corpses of flesh and putting it on display. Vesalius, with his ear-bone necklace and artfully posed skeletons, was boastful of his work. By the 18th century, anatomists were less eager to crow about it. Alexander Munro, an expert in osteology, wrote a whole book on bones without ever once mentioning how to make a skeleton. William Hunter, a generation later, told his students that they should acquire a skeleton for personal use, but never published his lecture notes explaining the process of creating one.</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\">\u201cI was struck by Hunter and Monroe\u2019s aura of secrecy,\u201d says Guerrini. \u201cLooking at Hunter, in particular, he never published his anatomy lectures.\u201d The only reason she knows about his skeleton how-tos is that his students took notes, and those notes are still in archives, hidden away from public view.</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\">There is something eerie about the instruction that all, say, 30 students in an anatomy class should somehow acquire their own human skeletons. Hunter, Guerrini says, never specified where they were to find bodies, but students likely would have had to resort to grave-robbery, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.archaeology.org/issues/89-1305/features/737-royal-london-hospital-burials\">resurrection men</a>,\u201d or bribing gravediggers or hospital workers. (Hunter\u2019s brother was apparently an ace at body procurement.) Attitudes toward death had been changing in Europe, and the idea of a carving up a not-insubstantial number of bodies and selling their bones started to seem distasteful, even morally reprehensible. While Vesalius could joke about the fate of these bodies, \u201cWilliam Hunter acknowledged the \u2018necessary inhumanity\u2019 of dissection,\u2019\u201d Guerrini says.</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf item-body-last\">That didn\u2019t stop him from offering his own new-fangled techniques for skeleton-making. Like Vesalius, Hunter had strong opinions about the best strategies. \u201cIf you want the Bones to be white inject by the Aorta for two or three Hours which will return by the Veins,\u201d he wrote, without specifying what, exactly, should be injected. \u201cThen expose them to maggots.\u201d Or, if you had enough time, you could simply bury a body in a box by an anthill. It was, at least, a less hands-on method of stripping flesh from bones.</p>\n\n</section>\n</div></body></html>"}, "15429247": {"score": 1, "comments": [], "time": "2017-10-08 21:15:05", "url": "https://www.corposflex.com/ostrovit-saw-palmetto-90-tabs-beneficios-prostata", "text": "<html><body><div><div id=\"tab-description\" class=\"tab-content\" itemprop=\"description\"><h2><span><em><strong>Ostrovit Saw Palmetto 90 tabs 1000mg Beneficios </strong></em></span></h2>\n\u00a0<p><strong><em><a href=\"https://www.corposflex.com/ostrovit-suplementos-portugal\">Ostrovit</a> Saw Palmetto 90 tabs</em></strong> com poderosa dosagem de 1000mg por comprimido contendo puro extrato da planta. <strong>Ostrovit Saw Palmetto</strong> \u00e9 super suplemento nutricional com imensos benef\u00edcios para homens e mulheres e que pode comprar agora em Portugal com pre\u00e7o mais baixo online.<br/>\n<br/>\n<span><strong>Saw Palmetto Beneficios para Mulheres:</strong></span><br/>\nEst\u00e1 comprovado que baixos \u00edndices de testosterona no corpo de mulheres e homens s\u00e3o a causa de libido fraco.

password hint bug, so our first step is to extract\u00a0<code>Applications/Utilities/Disk Utility.app/Contents/MacOS/Disk Utility</code> \u00a0and to compare it with the same binary from a stock macOS 10.13 High Sierra. For this, I have written an Emacs extension that launches <a href=\"https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">IDA</a> whenever I load a Mach-O file in a buffer, generates a SQL database with information about the decompiled functions, loads the patched binary, and finally outputs a diff generated by <a href=\"https://github.com/joxeankoret/diaphora\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Diaphora</a>. This technique is useful for deconstructing binaries that have been updated by a minor patch release because there are usually just a few changes and common heuristics work well.</p>\n<p>The diff between both versions of the Disk Utility binary revealed no differences in the decompilation:</p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"126\" data-permalink=\"https://cocoaengineering.com/2017/10/08/reverse-engineering-macos-high-sierra-supplemental-update/virtualbox_windows-10_08_10_2017_13_20_16/\" data-orig-file=\"https://cocoaengineering.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/virtualbox_windows-10_08_10_2017_13_20_16.png?w=640\" data-orig-size=\"409,46\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"VirtualBox_Windows 10_08_10_2017_13_20_16\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://cocoaengineering.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/virtualbox_windows-10_08_10_2017_13_20_16.png?w=640?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://cocoaengineering.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/virtualbox_windows-10_08_10_2017_13_20_16.png?w=640?w=409\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-126\" src=\"https://cocoaengineering.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/virtualbox_windows-10_08_10_2017_13_20_16.png?w=640\" alt=\"VirtualBox_Windows 10_08_10_2017_13_20_16\" srcset=\"https://cocoaengineering.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/virtualbox_windows-10_08_10_2017_13_20_16.png 409w, https://cocoaengineering.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/virtualbox_windows-10_08_10_2017_13_20_16.png?w=150 150w, https://cocoaengineering.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/virtualbox_windows-10_08_10_2017_13_20_16.png?w=300 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 409px) 100vw, 409px\"/></p>\n<p>That usually means that the only substantial changes reside in one of the linked frameworks. The most interesting one for this investigation is StorageKit, a private Apple framework that exposes APFS functionality to Disk Utility. It has two parts: a client library and a daemon, <code>storagekitd</code>. The client connects to the daemon using an Apple standard <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xpc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">XPC mechanism</a>. The daemon executes the operations (represented as subclasses of <code>NSOperation</code>) that the client demands.

Removed lines removed are depicted in red, added lines in green, and changes in yellow. The above function basically creates an instance of <code>NSMutableDictionary</code>\u00a0(Cocoa\u2019s representation of a hash table) and fills it with information about the volume. This dictionary is passed to <code>addChildVolumeToAPFSContainer:optionsDictionary:handlingProgressForOperationUUID:completionBlock:</code>\u00a0as the <code>optionsDictionary</code>\u00a0argument.</p>\n<p>The most interesting keys in the dictionary are <code>kSKAPFSDiskPasswordOption</code>\u00a0and <code>kSKAPFSDiskPasswordHintOption</code>, which are responsible for storing the password and the password hint, respectively. The bug is that the same variable, which contains the password, (represented in the decompilation as the same virtual register, <code>v50</code>) was used as value for both\u00a0keys in the dictionary, meaning that the clear password was incorrectly sent as a password hint via XPC.

Apparently, <code>Disk Utility</code>\u00a0and command line\u00a0<code>diskutil</code>\u00a0use different code paths. \u00a0<code>StorageKit</code>\u00a0does not appear as a direct dependency of <code>diskutil</code>, or in the transitive closure of its dependencies.

Effective unit testing requires sensing outputs reliably and asserting that they are expected, so side effects from functions complicate unit testing a bit. In this particular bug, the side effect is the communication with the XPC service, so separating the logic that creates the dictionary from the part that communicates with the service would help. When a software design is not easily testable, companies rely excessively on manual testing, which is not a very effective way of testing, given the high number of combinations that is typical in modern software (<i>did the QA engineer test setting a password *and* a password hint?, </i>easily\u00a0forgettable on a tight deadline).</p>\n<h3>Code review</h3>\n<p>Code review is the practice of reviewing code before or after it lands the main development branch in a software project.

Those who encountered poor visibility mid-flight told harrowing tales of disorientation and confusion. Surrounded on all sides by milk-white fog or hazy darkness, pilots entered a world where nothing behaved as it should. When they observed the plane slipping into a gentle descent, they corrected to gain altitude, only to find the plane diving downward faster. Or, when they were certain the plane was flying level, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn_and_slip_indicator\" data-omni-click=\"r'article',r'link',r'5',r'542304'\">turn indicator</a> would register a turn to the right. What the instrument registered as level, meanwhile, felt like a turn to the left.</p><p>Under these conditions, bailing out often became the best option. Those who didn\u2019t often joined their plane as it crashed into the ground.</p><aside class=\"pullquote instapaper_ignore\">To tame the death spiral, devices had to become part of how aviators kept control of the plane.</aside><p>Lost in the clouds, these pilots had fallen prey to a form of sensory disorientation known as a <em>death spiral</em>, or, more commonly, a <em>graveyard spiral</em>. The term describes an almost instinctive set of maneuvers pilots undertake when they lose sight of the horizon. The graveyard spiral begins when a plane flying in these conditions enters a gentle turn. As it turns, the plane will begin to descend, picking up speed.</p><p>Death spirals occur because the pilot feels the descent but not the turn. That has to do with the way the human body relies both on the visual and vestibular systems to perceive its orientation in space. As fluid moves through the small canals in the inner ear, the brain registers the body\u2019s shifts in position. The fluid moves when the head turns, creating the sensation that the vessel under control is doing the turning. In mid-flight, though, the fluid can settle in place. If this happens, a turn can feel like level flight. In this situation, a pilot who follows the instruments and levels the plane\u2019s wings feels, with absolute certainty, that the craft is turning in the <em>opposite</em> direction.</p></section><p class=\"ad-boxright-wrapper\" data-pos=\"boxright\"><gpt-ad id=\"boxright1\" targeting-pos=\"boxright1\" class=\"ad ad-boxright\" lazy-load=\"2\" data-object-pk=\"3\" data-object-name=\"boxright\"><gpt-sizeset viewport-size=\"[0, 0]\" sizes=\"[[300, 250]]\"/><gpt-sizeset viewport-size=\"[1010, 0]\" sizes=\"[[300, 250], [300, 600]]\"/></gpt-ad></p><section id=\"article-section-3\"><p>A pilot who recorrects to what feels level in his or her body simply reinitiates the spiral dive. Likewise, pulling back on the yoke to gain altitude without leveling the wings only tightens the plane\u2019s downward spiral. Without a clear view of the horizon to correct against, the pilot can become so disoriented that a total loss of control results, ending in a crash. An Air Safety Institute scare-tactic training video, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7t4IR-3mSo\" data-omni-click=\"r'article',r'link',r'6',r'542304'\">178 Seconds to Live</a>,\u201d follows a pilot through the disorientation of a classic graveyard spiral.</p><p>Once it became clear that aviators were becoming disoriented in the clouds, they set themselves to the task of figuring out how to avoid it. This was the birth of what is known as \u201cinstrument flight.\u201d Planes already carried basic instruments, such as turn and bank indicators, but these were primarily seen as navigational devices\u2014implements that helped pilots reach a destination rather than keep the plane in the air. To tame the death spiral, these devices had to become part of how aviators kept control of the plane.</p><p>In 1932, William Ocker and Carl Crane published <em>Blind Flight in Theory and Practice</em>, a detailed guide to flying by instruments through darkness and fog. Ocker and Crane\u2019s method relied on giving the pilot a visual reference against which to double-check the body\u2019s fallible sensations. A turn and bank indicator shows the wings\u2019 departure from level flight, and an artificial horizon visually represents the plane\u2019s relation to the ground.</p><aside class=\"pullquote instapaper_ignore\">As pilots learned to trust their instruments, flight through clouds and fog became mundane.</aside><p>But designing and implementing instruments was the easy part. It was harder to teach pilots to <em>believe</em> what their instruments reported over (and against) the persuasive sensations they felt in their bodies. Here Ocker and Crane ran up against aviators\u2019 long-standing belief that they controlled the plane, at least in part, through their superior \u201c<a href=\"https://archive.org/stream/equilibriumverti00jonerich#page/32/mode/2up/search/air+sense\" data-omni-click=\"r'article',r'link',r'7',r'542304'\">air sense</a>\u201d\u2014their body\u2019s special ability to maintain its equilibrium in flight. The idea that skillful flight depended on the body\u2019s perception of its own weight and relative position, sometimes called \u201c<a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=Y80tAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22graveyard+spiral%22&amp;dq=%22graveyard+spiral%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjD3JvR5onVAhWlx4MKHZQFCs84oAEQ6AEINTAE\" data-omni-click=\"r'article',r'link',r'8',r'542304'\">deep sensibility</a>\u201d or kinesthesia, was a truism among pilots. (Aviators referred to this skill as their ability to \u201cfly by the seat of the pants,\u201d a phrase that connoted, perhaps falsely, skill more than luck.)</p><p>Ocker and Crane started demonstrating the limits of the pilot\u2019s body, spinning skeptical pilots in chairs until they were dizzy, or showing them the curves their bodies traced when they tried to walk a straight line without the aid of vision. They even blindfolded homing pigeons and threw them out of a plane to demonstrate that even nature\u2019s best fliers would lose all sense of orientation without sight. (The pigeons spiraled helplessly, <a href=\"https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015021077964;view=1up;seq=53\" data-omni-click=\"r'article',r'link',r'9',r'542304'\">Ocker and Crane reported</a>, until they finally spread their wings parachute-style and floated, unharmed, to the ground.)

Hence the aviator\u2019s need for instruments: They gave back the horizon clouds and fog had obscured.</p></section><p class=\"ad-boxinjector-wrapper\"><gpt-ad id=\"boxinjector2\" targeting-pos=\"boxinjector2\" class=\"ad ad-boxinjector\" lazy-load=\"2\" data-object-pk=\"1\" data-object-name=\"boxinjector\"><gpt-sizeset viewport-size=\"[0, 0]\" sizes=\"[[300, 250], [320, 350], [300, 350], [1, 3], [320, 520], [320, 430], [1, 4], [1, 1], [1, 5]]\"/><gpt-sizeset viewport-size=\"[760, 0]\" sizes=\"[[728, 90], [728, 350], [1, 3], [768, 350], [768, 520], [640, 360], [760, 350], [1, 4], [1, 5]]\"/><gpt-sizeset viewport-size=\"[1010, 0]\" sizes=\"[[728, 90], [728, 350], [970, 250], [1, 3], [768, 350], [768, 520], [640, 360], [970, 350], [760, 350], [1, 4], [1, 5]]\"/><gpt-sizeset viewport-size=\"[1050, 0]\" sizes=\"[[728, 90], [728, 350], [970, 250], [1024, 350], [1, 3], [1600, 520], [1000, 350], [1600, 500], [970, 350], [760, 350], [1, 4], [1, 5]]\"/></gpt-ad></p><section id=\"article-section-4\"><p>A wary stance toward bodily perceptions would become a guiding principle for instrument flight.

But there\u2019s also hope in the death spiral: Crashes aren\u2019t inevitable\u2014so long as there\u2019s instrumentation to help find a horizon.</p><hr/><p><small><em>This article appears courtesy of </em><a href=\"http://objectsobjectsobjects.com\" data-omni-click=\"r'article',r'link',r'29',r'542304'\">Object Lessons</a>.</small></p></section>\n    \n    </div>\n\n    </div></body></html>"}, "15429729": {"score": 2, "comments": [], "time": "2017-10-08 23:05:14", "url": "https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-adoption-public-cloud-likely-wont-exceed-17-percent-mark-thiele/?published=t", "text": "UNAVAILABLE TEXT BY URL https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-adoption-public-cloud-likely-wont-exceed-17-percent-mark-thiele/?published=t"}, "15429219": {"score": 1, "comments": [], "time": "2017-10-08 21:08:32", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufXl2ao6_lM", "text": "<html><body><div><div id=\"action-panel-rental-required\" class=\"action-panel-content hid\">\n      <p id=\"watch-actions-rental-required\">\n    <strong>\u041e\u0446\u0435\u043d\u043a\u0430 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435 \u0430\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0434\u044b \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043e-</strong>\n  </p>\n\n  </div>\n\n  <div id=\"action-panel-error\" class=\"action-panel-content hid\">\n    <p class=\"action-panel-error\">\n      \u0412 \u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043c\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442 \u044d\u0442\u0430 \u0444\u0443\u043d\u043a\u0446\u0438\u044f \u043d\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f\u043d\u0430. \u041f\u043e\u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043f\u044b\u0442\u043a\u0443 \u043f\u043e\u0437\u0436\u0435.\n    </p>\n  </div>\n\n    </div></body></html>"}, "15431268": {"score": 2, "comments": [], "time": "2017-10-09 05:48:42", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/world/europe/belarus-minsk-technology.html", "text": "<html><body><div><div class=\"story-body story-body-2\">\n        <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"315\" data-total-count=\"2377\" id=\"story-continues-4\">Ten days after the awards, Facebook bought the company for an undisclosed sum.

Here is a selection of best Blu-ray creators with GPU acceleration that can help you create/make Blu-rays easily and quickly.</p>&#13;\n                        </div>&#13;\n                        &#13;\n                    </div>&#13;\n     &#13;\n                    <div class=\"page-txt-box why-choose\">&#13;\n                        &#13;\n<p>&#13;\n\tThis is a useful piece of software that is powerful and skilful in converting video formats from various sources, that is, whether it is your camcorder, iPhone MOV files, common SD videos, HD recordings and many others to BD or AVCHD formats for playback by storing them into DVDs or even external storage devices after the conversion. Of course, you can burn them directly to DVDs or Blu-ray Disks. Additionally, you can create ISO files. There are many other output formats too, including BD 5, BD 9 too. It is a completely compatible video to Blu-ray converter with all kinds of players you can possibly encounter around you, at someone\u2019s place or at a store.</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\n\tIt allows even more than just burning a video to a DVD. It also allows you to merge, rearrange their order of playback. The software also allows you to preview the playback while burning the files in real-time. This is computationally expensive but is quite possible with the DVDFab Blu-ray Creator. It is all doable with a very simple UI. The details are abstracted for simplicity and convenience. Now, this brings onto the next set of features that make is work seamlessly and faster than many others. It can be all attributed to the GPU acceleration technology. It is the same that powers visual effects in movies like Batman and Superman. The same technology that makes the number crunching is achieved with full compatibility with Intel Quick Sync, NVIDIA CUDA for CPU+GPU utilization. This doubles up the amount of work that can be completed in the time consumed. Along with it, it can also utilize multiple cores to do parallel processing.</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\n\t<img src=\"/upload/resource/258f239be1539ad27701677776239dd8.jpeg\"/></p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\n\tAll the above contributes to the real-time preview and editing works that you might want to do during burning or create your Blu-ray video. This piece of software has been in development for years and is updated to include the latest cutting-edge technology in terms of encryption and decryption standards, processing protocols, hardware and GPU usage to give you a comfortable experience. The experience is all that matters and the time saved when doing really intensive input-output tasks, maybe for you or for commercial applications. It is, however, not a freeware but can be purchased for a very nominal value. And, of course, you get support if you need to create Blu-ray at your ease.</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\n\t\u00a0</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>&#13;\n\tThere are some functionalities that are quite commonly granted to be available in any video converter software. Leawo is a similar video to Blu-ray converter that allows one to convert between various types of video file formats you can find on the web as well as from video recordings of your own devices. The complete list of supported file formats can be viewed from their official link.</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\n\t<img src=\"/upload/resource/5209668873bd2d7cbfc25889e7c81125.jpeg\"/></p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\n\tHere is something it also does in addition to that. This is 2D to 3D conversion. It is usually runs on Windows 10 and backward compatible up to XP, although it is hard that anyone willing to keep to the latest standards in Blu-ray DVD creation would be still using XP. Furthermore, the 2D to 3D conversion and other stuff make use of 64 bit OS and XP is not. It contains inbuilt <strong>Blu ray creator</strong> settings for different channels like red, blue and green, interleaved mode and others that make it quite convenient and simple to convert videos. It allows you to adjust 3D depth. The converted videos are compatible with all standard video players from Sony, Philips and so on, as per the market popularity. In addition, it is also compatible with parallel processing using multiple CPUs at once.</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\n\t\u00a0</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>&#13;\n\tThis product from Xilisoft is another well-written piece of software. It too supports a plethora of formats for input and output video, mostly BD and AVCHD file types to create Blu ray DVDs.\u00a0 This is essential to create or burn video files to DVDs and is a typical Blu-ray converter. The catch is in its advertising policy or marketing strategy that gives you money back within 30 days, however, the exact terms and conditions are not known. Anyways, the software has some editing options of its own as in adding custom watermarks and special effects, as they call it. Again, there is no such list to browse. It also allows you to do something called video compare, perhaps for editing purpose in real-time. These bunches of features also allow you to add subtitles. You can merge audio tracks from other places, remove its own sounds. These can be done via a very simple UI with no knowledge of anything like Adobe\u2019s Software Suites.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\n\t<img src=\"/upload/resource/11015fb96ba23164ea5807cb2e98939d.jpeg\"/></p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\n\tAgain, it also features Intel Quick Sync, NVIDIA\u2019s CUDA burning and GPU acceleration for video editing as well. Of course, your system has to support them too in terms of hardware requirements. The footnotes would cover a wide range of compatibility across various brands like Sony, JVC, Canon, and Philips among many others. There is a very lucrative offer for trying the software before you can be sure to make a purchase. The support regarding issues is not yet established, but considering the widespread usage, it must be really worth a shot. And, it supports up to iPhone 4 movie recording formats, according to their site.</p>&#13;\n                    </div>&#13;\n                    &#13;\n                    </div></body></html>"}, "15429736": {"score": 2, "comments": [], "time": "2017-10-08 23:06:36", "url": "https://www.citylab.com/equity/2017/10/the-heterogeneous-future-of-urban-mobility/541206/", "text": "<html><body><div><article class=\"l-article s-cms-content\" itemscope=\"itemscope\" itemtype=\"https://schema.org/NewsArticle\">\n    <meta itemprop=\"datePublished\" content=\"2017-10-06T12:42:51-04:00\"/>\n    <meta itemprop=\"dateModified\" content=\"2017-10-06T12:42:51-04:00\"/>\n    <meta itemprop=\"mainEntityOfPage\" content=\"https://www.citylab.com/equity/2017/10/the-heterogeneous-future-of-urban-mobility/541206/\"/>\n    \n\n    \n    \n<figure class=\"c-lead-image\" itemprop=\"image\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\">\n  <picture class=\"c-lead-image__image\">\n    \n      <source srcset=\"https://cdn.citylab.com/media/img/citylab/2017/10/RTX3BDHV/940.jpg?mod=1507307517\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px)\">\n    \n    \n      <source srcset=\"https://cdn.citylab.com/media/img/citylab/2017/10/RTX3BDHV/lead_large.jpg?mod=1507307517\" media=\"(min-width: 576px)\">\n    \n    <meta itemprop=\"height\" content=\"128\"/>\n    <meta itemprop=\"width\" content=\"300\"/>\n    <meta itemprop=\"url\" content=\"https://cdn.citylab.com/media/img/citylab/2017/10/RTX3BDHV/300.jpg?mod=1507307517\"/>\n    <source srcset=\"https://cdn.citylab.com/media/img/citylab/2017/10/RTX3BDHV/300.jpg?mod=1507307517\" media=\"(max-width: 575px)\">\n    <img class=\"c-lead-image__img\" srcset=\"https://cdn.citylab.com/media/img/citylab/2017/10/RTX3BDHV/300.jpg?mod=1507307517\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"contentUrl\"/>\n    <noscript><img class=\"c-lead-image__img\" src=\"https://cdn.citylab.com/media/img/citylab/2017/10/RTX3BDHV/300.jpg?mod=1507307517\" alt=\"\"/></noscript>\n  </source></source></source></picture>\n  <figcaption class=\"c-lead-image__credit\">\n    <span class=\"c-lead-image__caption\" itemprop=\"caption\">A French-made autonomous bus cruises through a university campus in Taipei.</span>\n    <span class=\"c-lead-image__attribution\" itemprop=\"creator\">Tyrone Siu/Reuters</span>\n    </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n    \n\n    <div class=\"l-article__meta\">\n      <h1 class=\"l-article__hed\" itemprop=\"headline\">The Heterogeneous Future of Urban Mobility </h1>\n      \n    </div>\n    <p class=\"l-article__dek o-small-container\" itemprop=\"description\">The authors of <em>Smarter, Faster, Greener </em>talk about the technologies that will revolutionize how we get around cities.</p>\n\n    <section class=\"c-tmp-share-sponsored-container o-small-container js-action-bar-active\">\n      \n      \n    </section>\n\n    \n\n    <section class=\"s-article__section o-small-container\" id=\"article-section-1\"><p>The telecommunications ecosystem has come a long way from land lines and fax machines.

Once limited almost exclusively to cars in most American cities, urban mobility in the future will be defined by a diverse range of modes, from bike share to autonomous transit, as well as more traditional options like rail and walking. As scholars of business who have worked with the auto industry, it is notable that these authors are making such bold claims about urban mobility. In the lightly edited interview that follows, we discuss the technologies powering this revolutionary shift, and how even the most auto-dependent cities can adapt to it.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><strong>You are the nation\u2019s leading experts on cars <s>\u2013 </s>some of you are part of the same research group that literally wrote the book on the automobile industry, <em>The Machine That Changed the World.</em> Now, a couple of decades later, <em>Faster, Smarter, Greener </em>details a veritable \u201cperfect storm\u201d of factors that is ushering in a new era of urban mobility.

As a result of a denser urban population, many of the world\u2019s cities are choking on congestion and ground level pollution, driving up health costs, and grid-locking economic growth opportunities. On the global scale, carbon dioxide pollution, which automobiles contribute to significantly, is degrading the conditions of life on our planet, both for humans and the ecosystems on which we rely.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Furthermore, a population increasingly comprising digital natives and digital immigrants has altered expectations of how they want to live and move. Their world is perpetually connected and their lives are increasingly dependent on new service models across a wide swath of economic activity.

Ride-sharing contributes through increasing utilization of cars and can contribute to easing congestion in cities. The average car in the U.S. sits idle for 96 percent of its life. Increasing asset use will have economic and environmental benefits. Further, as we gain experience with driver-less cars, we may anticipate a future when cars may be summoned, used and released with a few taps on a smartphone.

There will be those cities and regions that embrace the idea of connected, heterogeneous, and intelligent mobility architectures, build coalitions of companies, citizens, and regional planners to work together, and align policies and investments accordingly. These cities will win in the sense that they provide improvement for their citizens in healthy and pleasant environments, as well as greater opportunities for economic growth.

But if it weren't for a Federal Communication Commission (FCC) regulatory decision in 2001, we might all still be using it.</p> <p>Sixteen years ago, the FCC, the regulatory body responsible for things like television and radio, approved a merger between American Online and Time Warner, but with several conditions. As part of the deal, AOL was <a href=\"http://cnnfn.cnn.com/2001/01/11/deals/hold_aol/\" target=\"_blank\">required</a> to make its web portal compatible with other chat apps. </p> <p>The government stopped AOL from building a closed system where everyone had to use AIM, meaning it had to adopt interoperability\u2014the ability to be compatible with other computer systems.</p> <p>The FCC required AOL to be compatible with at least one instant messaging rival immediately after the merger went through. Within six months, the FCC required AOL to make its portal compatible with at least two other rivals, or face penalties.</p> <p>\"What interoperability said in 2001 was that the relationships you have on AOL messenger are your relationships. And if you want to use a different product to access those relationships, you can,\" Matt Stoller, a fellow at the <a href=\"https://openmarketsinstitute.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Open Markets Institute</a> told me on a phone call. </p> <p>The FCC's decision changed how we communicate with each other on the internet. By forcing AIM to make room for competition, a range of messaging apps and services, as well as social networks emerged. Instead of being limited to AIM, people who used AOL's portal could choose other platforms.</p> <p>The FCC imposed the restrictions on AOL because the merger with Time Warner created the largest biggest media business in the country. Government regulators feared that the behemoth would become a powerful monopoly, particularly when it came to instant messaging. At the time, AOL <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/12/business/fcc-approves-aol-time-warner-deal-with-conditions.html\" target=\"_blank\">had over</a> 140 million customers\u2014or <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2000/06/ms-to-aol-end-im-stranglehold/\" target=\"_blank\">90 percent</a> of the market\u2014 using AIM as well as its other chat service, ICQ, combined.</p> <p>The FCC's decision to force AOL to remain open provides a blueprint for how the government could similarly regulate today's gigantic internet platforms, like Facebook.<br/><br/> Stoller said you can look at Facebook\u2014with its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/27/facebook-2-billion-users/\" target=\"_blank\">over 2 billion monthly users</a>\u2014as having egregious control over our relationships on the internet, or what he calls the \"social grid.\" If Facebook were forced to make room for other services on its platform in the same way AOL made room for other chat apps, new services could emerge.</p> <p>\"Facebook has to allow people to access their relationships however they want through other businesses or tools that are not controlled by Facebook,\" Stoller said. \"Having them control and mediate the structure of those relationships\u2014that's not right.\"</p> <p>Of course, people can opt out of Facebook and choose to use other, smaller social networks. But those businesses are essentially unable to thrive because of the hold Facebook has on how we communicate online. All our friends and family are already on Facebook, and because the platform is not regulated to allow competition, it's incredibly difficult for other, newer ones to emerge.</p> <p>Trying to build a competitor to Facebook in 2017 is \"just insane, it doesn't make any sense,\" said Stoller, who is writing book on the history of monopoly power in the twentieth century. \"It would be like starting a competitor to your local water company.\"</p> <p>The FCC's decision freed other companies to build new, better <a href=\"https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/pg9x5b/best-messaging-apps-ranked\">instant-messaging apps</a> without AOL standing in their way.

So, you cannot depend on affiliate marketing. But if you put in some extra effort, then you can increase you commissions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\u00a0Before entering into this field, a lot of people are under the false assumption that affiliate marketing is basically a short-cut way of becoming rich without much effort. Actually it is not such an easy business. Don\u2019t think that you will put a couple of banners on your website and you will start earning.\n\n\n\n</p><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-5880306699717979\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-layout=\"in-article\" data-ad-slot=\"9578262030\"/>\n\n<b><i><span>READ ALSO: <a href=\"http://www.mistatech.com/2017/09/mistatech-benefits-of-affiliate.html\">Benefits of affiliate marketing</a></span></i></b>\n\n\n\n<p>\nThere are some tips to increase your affiliate commissions:\n\n</p><b><i><span>1. Build a good website\u00a0</span></i></b><p>\nGood website means, a website that attracts the visitors\u2019 attention. It must not be rich in graphics. It should be simple and easy to navigate. It should be simple for the visitor to find anything that he wants.\n\n</p><b><i><span>2. Do Search Engine Optimization</span></i></b><p>\nSearch engine optimization is very necessary to drive steady traffic to your site. This is a very big topic. There are various techniques to increase the page rank of your website. Banner exchange is a famous technique. Search engine friendly URLs is another search engine optimization technique.\n\n\n\n</p><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-5880306699717979\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-layout=\"in-article\" data-ad-slot=\"9578262030\"/>\n\n<b><i><span>3. Pick the Right Merchant</span></i></b><p>\nPick the right merchant to start with. Don\u2019t look at the profits offered. Look at the expertise and experience of the merchants. See their history. How many products they have launched in the markets and how many were successful. Are they good in marketing? Are they providing good service to their customers?\n</p><p>\nFind the answers of all above questions and you will find the right merchant that will give you good and constant business.\n\n</p><b><i><span><br/></span></i></b>\n<b><i><span>4. Increase Traffic to Your Website</span></i></b><p>\nGetting a lot of traffic to your site is basically the key factor in this field. You must remember that not every visitor is your buyer. Only a few of them will buy your product, so it is important to get more and more traffic to your website. Some important techniques are email campaigns, banner exchange, RSS feeds, selection of the right keywords, writing search engine friendly content on your website etc.\n\n</p><b><i><span>5. Pre Sales</span></i></b><p>\nAn important point is to read the minds of your visitors to understand what they need and then offer them the right thing at the right cost. Try to attract your visitors with the extra things that they would like. For example, if you are selling laptops on your website, then you can put some useful articles on how to troubleshoot laptops. This will attract your visitors.\n</p><p>\nIt is possible that your visitor might not make a sale in the first visit. But if he likes your articles he will come back to study your articles and it is possible that he may make a purchase after some visits. This concept of offering some useful free gifts to your visitors is called pre sales. It is very helpful in increasing your sales.\n</p><p>\nYou cannot get the desired results in a few days, but it requires some time. Concentrate on how to improve your business by making a good website and driving more and more traffic to your website. Choose the right merchant and attract the people by offering useful products and gift packages.

The goal is to make writing things like Forms\nand Seralizers much easier by providing a declarative way to encode\nyour complex validation logic.</p>\n<p>Most Forms and Serializers limit you to doing validation on a single\nfield, and then have one single <code>clean</code> method where you can do\nmuti-field validation logic. The problem with this is that if you have a\nlarge number of optional fields which depend on each other, your\nvalidation code can quickly become unreadable, unmaintainable and\nnon-reusable.</p>\n<p>The aim of Required is to do the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To have a declarative way to encode validation logic</li>\n<li>Allow you to maintain extremely complex multi field validation logic</li>\n<li>Allow you to reuse your validation logic easily</li>\n<li>Be flexible with what you want to validate</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If this all sounds good.

It has two non-optional arguments, the first one is the target (key) of the constraint, and the second argument is the constraint itself. <code>Requires(\"start_date\", \"end_date\")</code> means \"start_date requires end_date to be present\".</p>\n<p>The <code>R</code> object acts as a placeholder for a future value. If you require a future value of <code>end_date</code> to be more than <code>start_date</code>, you would write it as <code>R(\"end_date\") &gt; R(\"start_date)</code>. Any such expression can be used as the constraint for the <code>Requires</code> object.</p>\n<p>The last step is simply summing all the  <code>Requires</code> together in order to combine the rules:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-python\"><pre><span class=\"pl-c\"><span class=\"pl-c\">#</span> combine all the rules</span>\nall_rules <span class=\"pl-k\">=</span> (\n    start_requires_end <span class=\"pl-k\">+</span> \n    start_after_2017 <span class=\"pl-k\">+</span>\n    start_before_2018 <span class=\"pl-k\">+</span>\n    end_requires_start <span class=\"pl-k\">+</span>\n    end_before_2018 <span class=\"pl-k\">+</span>\n    end_after_start\n)</pre></div>\n<p>Once you have combined all the rules, you can simply call validate on the <code>all_rules</code> object with a dict of your data you want to validate.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-python\"><pre>data <span class=\"pl-k\">=</span> {\n    <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>start_date<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span>: datetime.date(<span class=\"pl-c1\">2017</span>, <span class=\"pl-c1\">10</span>, <span class=\"pl-c1\">10</span>),\n    <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>end_date<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span>: datetime.date(<span class=\"pl-c1\">2017</span>, <span class=\"pl-c1\">10</span>, <span class=\"pl-c1\">9</span>),\n}\n\nall_rules.validate(data)  \n<span class=\"pl-c\"><span class=\"pl-c\">#</span> RequirementError: end_date requires end_date to be greater than start_date</span></pre></div>\n<p>The above not only tells you that the data was invalid, but which rule it broke.

A Denver Post analysis of federal data shows the aquifer shrank twice as fast over the past six years compared with the previous 60.</p>\n<p>While the drying out of America's agricultural bread basket ($35 billion in crops a year) ultimately may pinch people in cities, it is hitting rural areas hardest.</p>\n<p>\u201cNow I never know, from one minute to the next, when I turn on a faucet or hydrant, whether there will be water or not. The aquifer is being depleted,\u201d said Lois Scott, 75, who lives west of Cope, north of the frequently bone-dry bed of the Arikaree River.</p>\n<p>A 40-foot well her grandfather dug by hand in 1914 gave water until recently, she said, lamenting the loss of lawns where children once frolicked and green pastures for cows.

Farmers say they cannot handle this on their own.</p>\n<p>But there is no agreement among the eight affected states (Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Wyoming, South Dakota) to try to save the aquifer. And state rules allow total depletion.</p>\n<p>In fact, Colorado officials faced with legal challenges from Kansas over dwindling surface water in the Republican River have found that their best option to comply with a 1942 compact is to take more water out of the aquifer. The state bought wells from farmers during the past decade and has been pumping out 11,500 acre-feet of water a year, enough to satisfy a small city, delivering it through a $60 million, <a href=\"http://www.denverpost.com/2013/12/20/pipeline-from-colorado-wells-may-ease-republican-river-water-dispute/\">12-mile pipeline northeast of Wray</a> to artificially resuscitate the river.</p>\n<p>The overpumping reflects a pattern, seen worldwide, where people with knowledge that they're exceeding nature's limits nevertheless cling to destructive practices that hasten an environmental backlash.</p>\n<h3>The drawdown</h3>\n<img class=\" lazyautosizes lazyload\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/dryland_water_2017_rj_29505.jpg?w=620&amp;crop=0%2c0px%2c100%2c9999px\" alt=\"cattle gather around a water hole ...\"/>\n<p class=\"photo-credit\">RJ Sangosti, The Denver Post</p><p>\nCattle gather around a water hole at a ranch north of Burlington on Sept. 12, 2017 in Burlington. The feeder stream from the South Fork Republican River, one of three tributaries that originate in the High Plains of Northeastern Colorado, is slowly drying up.\n</p><p>The depletion of the High Plains Aquifer has been happening for decades, according to bulletins U.S. Geological Survey has put out since 1988. Colorado farmers this year pumped groundwater out of 4,000 wells, state records show, siphoning as much as 500 gallons a minute from each well to irrigate roughly 580,000 acres - mostly to grow corn, a water-intensive crop.</p>\n<p>The depth where groundwater can be tapped has fallen by as much as 100 feet in eastern Colorado, USGS data show. That means pump motors must work harder to pull up the same amount of water, using more energy - raising costs for farmers. The amount of water siphoned from the aquifer since 1950 to irrigate farm fields across the eight states tops 273 million acre-feet (89 trillion gallons) - about 70 percent of the water in Lake Erie.</p>\n<a href=\"http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/cd08aquifer.jpg\"><img class=\" lazyload\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/cd08aquifer.jpg?w=620&amp;crop=0%2c0px%2c100%2c9999px\" alt=\" \"/></a><p>Click the graphic to enlarge it\n</p><p>On one hand, the industrial center-pivot irrigation techniques perfected after World War II have brought consistency to farming by tapping the \"sponge\" of saturated sediment that links the aquifer to surface water in streams and rivers. America's breadbasket produces $35 billion of crops a year. On the other hand, intense irrigation is breaking ecosystems apart.</p>\n<p>Overpumping has dried up 358 miles of surface rivers and streams across a 200-square-mile area covering eastern Colorado, western Kansas and Nebraska, according to U.S. Fish and Wildlife-backed researchers from Colorado State University and Kansas State University who published a peer-reviewed report in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The researchers also determined that, if farmers keep pumping water at the current pace, another 177 miles of rivers and streams will be lost before 2060.</p>\n<p>\"Intermittent streams are more likely to be dry. Permanent streams are more likely to become intermittent. Large streams are more likely to be small. Everything has changed,\u201d said KSU conservation biologist Keith Gido, one of the authors. \u201cWe have almost completely changed the species of fish that can survive in those streams, compared with what was there historically. This is really a catastrophic change.\"</p>\n<p>Disappearing fish species - minnows, suckers, catfish that had evolved to endure periodic droughts - signal to biologists that ecological effects may be reaching a tipping point.</p>\n<p>The amount of water held in the aquifer under eastern Colorado decreased by 19.6 million acre-feet - 6.4 trillion gallons - from 1950 until 2015, USGS records show. That's an average loss of 300,000 acre-feet a year. Between 2011 and 2015, records show, the water available under Colorado in the aquifer decreased by 3.2 million acre-feet - an annual average shrinkage of 800,000 acre-feet. Climate change factors, including rainfall, play into the rate of the drawdown.</p>\n<p>If all pumping stopped immediately, it would still take hundreds of years for rain-fed streams and rivers to recharge the aquifer, Gido said.</p>\n<p>\"We're not living in as sustainable a fashion as we need to be. Much of the damage has been done,\" he said, \"and restoring what we've lost could be difficult.</p>\n<p>\"It is happening all over the world in places such as Pakistan. It causes conflicts. As human populations grow, the demand for water is going to be greater. Conflicts are going to increase - unless we become more efficient in using the water we have.\"</p>\n<h3>Farmers locked</h3>\n<img class=\" lazyautosizes lazyload\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/dryland_water_2017_rj_27796.jpg?w=620&amp;crop=0%2c0px%2c100%2c9999px\" alt=\"rod lenz, president of the republican ...\"/>\n<p class=\"photo-credit\">RJ Sangosti, The Denver Post</p><p>\nRod Lenz, president of the Republican River Water Conservation District, walks pass a storage tank filled with water that will free-flow down a pipeline to a outfall at the Republican River on Sept. 12, 2017 in Wray. The water delivery is part of the Republican River Compact among Colorado, Kansas, and Nebraska.\n</p><p>For farmers, weaning themselves off groundwater is proving difficult.</p>\n<p>They say they're trying. They've reduced the land irrigated in eastern Colorado by 30,000 acres since 2006. They plan to retire another 25,000 acres over the next decade, said Rod Lenz, president of the Republican River Water Conservation District, who for years has advocated use of technology to grow more crops with less water.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have come to realize that, yeah, we are overmining it. We are acutely aware of that now. There's a definite attitude to make more than just the natural progression as far as efficiency,\u201d Lenz said, noting state officials monitor pumping and determine how many acres owners can irrigate.</p>\n<p>\"We're constantly trying to find ways to stay in compliance,\" he said. \"We're looking at serious conservation.\"</p>\n<p>For years, agriculture experts have pointed to drip-irrigation technology to do more with less.  Federal agencies in the past dangled help for farmers who invest. But few in eastern Colorado have installed these systems, largely because they are expensive.</p>\n<p>Farmer and cattleman Robert Boyd, a leader of the Arikaree Groundwater Management District, said the federal government should intervene to ensure survival of High Plains agriculture.</p>\n<p>\"Do you want us to be sustainable? Or not? It may come to a point where no one can actually irrigate,\" Boyd said.</p>\n<p>He pointed to proposals to divert water from the Missouri River Basin and move it westward through pipelines across the Great Plains.</p>\n<p>\"If the federal government wants agriculture to be sustainable, they need to pump water back toward the mountains. They need to figure out how to get water back toward the higher parts of the rivers,\" he said. \"The federal government needs to step in and make the states work together to make agriculture - and urban areas - sustainable.\"</p>\n<p>For now, farmers struggle, increasingly weighing water uncertainties in calculations that include corn prices falling to around $3.50 a bushel in recent years from $7. But drawing down the aquifer does not violate any law in Colorado. The state engineer's office monitors well levels and requires permits for wells, limiting the number of acres a farmer can irrigate. But there's no hard limit on how much water can be pumped.</p>\n<p>In contrast, state rules limit <a href=\"http://www.denverpost.com/2011/04/26/south-denver-suburbs-preparing-to-end-reliance-on-super-deep-wells/\">groundwater withdrawals from the Denver Basin Aquifer</a> - a source for many of Denver's <a href=\"http://www.denverpost.com/2014/12/09/denver-suburbs-drawing-down-groundwater-aim-for-renewable-supply/\">southern suburbs,</a> including Castle Rock and Parker - to less than 1 percent a year. This is meant to help natural recharge keep pace with human demands.</p>\n<p>But on the High Plains, the situation is like mining intended to fully exploit diamonds or gold.</p>\n<p>\"If you want to have it all back the way it was 150 years ago, you would have to remove everyone from the area. I'm not sure how we could do that today,\" deputy state engineer Mike Sullivan said in an interview.</p>\n<p>Sullivan and state engineer Kevin Rein emphasized that thousands of acres no longer are irrigated. \"And there need to be some more retirements of land to get us into a more balanced situation,\" Sullivan said.</p>\n<p>They defended Colorado's practice of pumping more groundwater out of the aquifer, saying this is necessary to comply with the Republican River Compact. Disputes over river flows have risen as far as the U.S. Supreme Court and Colorado's legal obligations to deliver water to Nebraska and Kansas are clear.</p>\n<p>\"What we do with the pumping does help the streams,\" Sullivan said. \"It does provide a wet stream. \u2026 We could not meet our (legal) obligation without that today, even if we turned off all the wells.\"</p>\n<p>But there's no end in sight for the drawdown of groundwater.</p>\n<img class=\" lazyautosizes lazyload\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/dryland_water_2017_rj_29370.jpg?w=620&amp;crop=0%2c0px%2c100%2c9999px\" alt=\"dust flies up as oscar ortiz, ...\"/>\n<p class=\"photo-credit\">RJ Sangosti, The Denver Post</p><p>\nDust flies up as Oscar Ortiz, a pen rider at Cure Feeders, works with the cattle on Sept. 13, 2017 in Idalia.

In the rural view, it is a problem that cannot be addressed by farmers alone without help from people in cities. All of the industrial <a href=\"http://www.denverpost.com/2017/03/05/gravel-pit-colorado-farmers-agriculture/\">agriculture is done with urban residents in mind - the people who consume the crops and cows that farmers grow</a>.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe world population is going to double. And we're not going to be able to grow more farmland. We're losing farming ground every day to development,\" said Cody Powell, manager of 21st Century Equipment, the John Deere dealer in Burlington, an agricultural hub. \u201cYou take away farm ground for development, bring in more people. Who's going to feed them? The only way to do that is to put water on crops.\"</p>\n<p>People in cities increasingly demand environmentally correct crops, which requires more water. \"If they want natural grain-fed cattle, and non-GMO (genetically modified organism) crops - all that good stuff - it is going to take water,\" he said.</p>\n<p>A farmer can grow more by using pesticides and genetically modified seeds, he said. \"With the same amount of water, you could get twice as much corn.\"</p>\n<p>He knows too well the perils of <a href=\"http://www.denverpost.com/2011/03/11/colorado-farmland-goes-dry-as-suburbs-secure-water-supplies/\">losing water. He grew up in southern Colorado's Arkansas River Valley</a> at a time when Aurora and other Front Range suburbs were buying up rights from farmers. This buy-up to slake growing suburban thirsts ended up killing agriculture across hundreds of thousands of once-irrigated acres.</p>\n<p>And now when Powell goes back, he sees communities \"overrun with thugs\" near where his grandmother lived. \"It makes me feel sick,\" he said.</p>\n<p>In eastern Colorado, the problem now is that <a href=\"http://www.denverpost.com/2015/08/01/colorado-farmers-grow-more-food-on-less-water-amid-rising-competition/\">few can afford to invest in high-efficiency water technology, such as irrigation drip tubes and tape installed underground to eliminate evaporation losses, and soil-sensor systems that let farmers irrigate only when absolutely necessary</a>.</p>\n<p>Federal programs to subsidize installation of this technology have withered. And the overpumping continues.</p>\n<p>\"The fear out here now is not that the aquifer is going to get ruined,\" Powell said. \"The fear is that the state is going to shut off wells.\"</p>\n<p>And prairie residents practically cringe to see the pipeline northeast of Wray that Colorado uses to convey groundwater away to Nebraska and Kansas to prevent future lawsuits.</p>\n<p>The interstate compact was negotiated back when there was more water and far fewer people, they say.</p>\n<p>\"Now we just have weeds. We are feeling the effect of losing the water that Kansas is enjoying,\" Scott said from her farmhouse. \"It is robbing families of life. That's what is happening to us. We should be entitled to the water underground.\"</p>\n<img class=\" lazyautosizes lazyload\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/dryland_water_2017_rj_27068.jpg?w=620&amp;crop=0%2c0px%2c100%2c9999px\" alt=\"a single stock of corn stands ...\"/>\n<p class=\"photo-credit\">RJ Sangosti, The Denver Post</p><p>\nA single stock of corn stands in a field, in Yuma County, after harvest on Sept. 12, 2017 in Idalia.\n</p><h3>Past becomes future</h3>\n<p>The depletion means water scarcity increasingly dictates survival.</p>\n<p>It is no surprise to historians. In the 1860s, John Wesley Powell's surveys for the U.S. government warned that the land west of central Kansas was practically a desert. His report \"On the Arid Lands of the Western United States\" warned that the only way for people to live here would be by irrigating land. Otherwise, he wrote, the place could not support permanent communities. Tribes for centuries used the Great Plains seasonally as a hunting ground.</p>\n<p>Settlers flocked in during the 19th century, initially relying on dryland farming. This led to massive soil erosion, culminating in the Dust Bowl environmental disaster of the 1930s.</p>\n<p>Industrial irrigation took off during the 1960s, with tens of thousands of wells drilled through the 1980s.</p>\n<p>But now, if people keep pumping, the dry-out will intensify, CSU senior research scientist Kevin Bestgen said.</p>\n<p>\"I appreciate it that people now are trying to reduce pumping. The reality is that the bucket they are pumping from does not refill. It is finite. And in order to allow recharge of that aquifer, farmers are going to have to get much more severe reductions in pumping levels. It has been going down and down and down,\" he said. \"People are getting what they can. This will turn out to be a tragedy. It is in the culture at this point. People want to grow corn now.\"</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"}, "15430257": {"score": 2, "comments": [], "time": "2017-10-09 01:06:56", "url": "https://www.mottocosmos.com/spring-beautiful-lethal/", "text": "<html><body><div><div><blockquote><p>April is the cruellest month,<br/>\nbreeding lilacs out of the dead land,<br/>\nmixing memory and desire<br/>\nstirring dull roots with spring rain.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>T.S. Eliot, \u201cThe Waste Land\u201d</strong></p>\n<h2><strong>Even poet\u2019s heart hurts as spring comes.</strong></h2>\n<p>The most beautiful season of time is the one that brings up all the pain.<br/>\nIt is not only literature. It is also statistics.<br/>\nAccording to psychologists, <strong>spring</strong> is the time when <strong>suicides</strong> increase rapidly.<br/>\nUnlike in the autumn and especially in the winter, when the phenomenon shows a recession, in <strong>spring</strong> and summer there is an outbreak of suicide and attempted suicide.<br/>\n\u201cIf we take winter as a baseline, then there\u2019s a 20-60% higher <strong>suicide</strong> rate during spring,\u201d says <strong>Fotis Papadopoulos</strong>, a professor of psychiatry at <strong><a href=\"https://www.uu.se/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Uppsala University</a></strong> in Sweden, who has been studying the association.<br/>\nMental health experts at the Priory group said that <strong>May</strong> is the peak month for suicides in Britain. \u201cThe increase can be dramatic, with up to 50% more successful suicides in some cases,\u201d says Chris Thompson, director of healthcare at the Priory group. In<strong> Britain</strong>, about 6,300 people take their own lives each year. On an average day, 105 Americans lose their lives to suicide. According to Thompson, the seasonal changes that bring most of us out of winter apathy may work against those who are coming out of severe depression:<br/>\n\u201cIt is a harsh irony that the partial remission which most depression sufferers experience in the spring often provides the boost of energy required for executing a suicide plan,\u201d he says. \u201cSpring is a time for new beginnings and new life, yet the juxtaposition between a literally blooming world and the barren inner life of the clinically depressed is often too much for them to bear.\u201d<br/>\nIn fact, studies dating back to the late 1800s find that suicides <strong>peak in the spring and are lowest in winter</strong>.<br/>\nOne 1995 study published in the journal Social Science &amp; Medicine examined monthly suicide rates in 28 countries and found that in 25 in the Northern Hemisphere, suicides were most common in May and ebbed in February. According to a 1997 study in the journal Psychiatry Research, r in the Southern Hemisphere \u2014 in South Africa, for example, suicides peak in the southern spring, in September and October. According to the U.S. Center for Disease Controlo and Prevention, the uptick begins in early April and late May.<br/>\nScientists look for the cause for many years now.<br/>\nIn 2016, <strong>Harvard professor of psychology Matthew Nock</strong> cited a study published in JAMA Psychiatry, that found that as hours of sunlight increased, so did the risk of suicide. As he said:<br/>\n\u201cThe authors speculate that sunlight could boost energy and motivation, thus giving people who are depressed the ability to take action and make a suicide attempt\u201d .<br/>\nThis means that spring is not the season people decide to suicide, but it is the season when they have the strength to commit it.<br/>\nThere is a particular disorder that, according to psychologists, cannot describe people who commit suicide at spring. It is called SAD: it is the Seasonal Affective Disorder, a form of depression that can be debilitating. According to mental health scientists . the two most common symptoms of depression are feelings of sadness and hopelessness, and losing interest in activities\u2014such as socializing\u2014that people normally find pleasurable. If someone experiences these symptoms every day for at least two weeks, it\u2019s a sign of depression. If the person feels this way only during the fall and winter, and if these symptoms disappear during the rest of the year, it may be a sign of SAD. That disorder cannot lead someone to commit suicide, because the symptoms are temporary. If they are not, then it is not SAD but depression. But why depressed people find April so hard to bear.</p>\n<h2>The Effect Of Serotonin</h2>\n<p>One theory says it\u2019s the result of changes in serotonin levels -the hormone that regulates mood-in the human body, All studies have shown that blood serotonin levels are elevated in the summer. Scientists resemble Spring, when the sun appears again, with the first few weeks of antidepressant administration to a patient.<br/>\nIn the first few weeks and before adjusting his mood, the patient feels a severe discomfort, perhaps even overstimulation. It is, perhaps, the most dangerous phase of treatment .<br/>\nAnd even if a psychiatrist can control the medication of a patient with depression, when it comes to the sun it is clear that the whole humanity will not be able to tame.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em><strong>A\u00a0 very sad phenomenon that grows day by day read about: <a href=\"https://www.mottocosmos.com/suicides/\">SUICIDES</a></strong></em></p>\n</div>\n</div></body></html>"}, "15430258": {"score": 1, "comments": [], "time": "2017-10-09 01:06:58", "url": "https://github.com/sman591/discourse-nntp-bridge", "text": "<html><body><div><article class=\"markdown-body entry-content\" itemprop=\"text\"><h1><a href=\"#discourse-nntp-bridge---\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\" id=\"user-content-discourse-nntp-bridge---\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"octicon octicon-link\" version=\"1.1\" viewbox=\"0 0 16 16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"/></svg></a>discourse-nntp-bridge <a href=\"https://travis-ci.org/sman591/discourse-nntp-bridge\"><img src=\"https://camo.githubusercontent.com/0ce0d919e6f5b857e964df635d7bcf515f89852a/68747470733a2f2f7472617669732d63692e6f72672f736d616e3539312f646973636f757273652d6e6e74702d6272696467652e7376673f6272616e63683d6d6173746572\" alt=\"Build Status\" data-canonical-src=\"https://travis-ci.org/sman591/discourse-nntp-bridge.svg?branch=master\"/></a> <a href=\"https://codeclimate.com/github/sman591/discourse-nntp-bridge\"><img src=\"https://camo.githubusercontent.com/f916571a364ccd6a560d8085700966ad93684af1/68747470733a2f2f636f6465636c696d6174652e636f6d2f6769746875622f736d616e3539312f646973636f757273652d6e6e74702d6272696467652f6261646765732f6770612e737667\" alt=\"Code Climate\" data-canonical-src=\"https://codeclimate.com/github/sman591/discourse-nntp-bridge/badges/gpa.svg\"/></a> <a href=\"https://hakiri.io/github/sman591/discourse-nntp-bridge/master\"><img src=\"https://camo.githubusercontent.com/07692227e27f5c40c13de43633ba574e3bc76a29/68747470733a2f2f68616b6972692e696f2f6769746875622f736d616e3539312f646973636f757273652d6e6e74702d6272696467652f6d61737465722e737667\" alt=\"security\" data-canonical-src=\"https://hakiri.io/github/sman591/discourse-nntp-bridge/master.svg\"/></a></h1>\n<p>NNTP bridge to keep NNTP &amp;

The Go language was conceived in September 2007 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson at Google. Go first appeared in November 2009, and the first version of the language was released in December 2012. The official web site of the Go project is http://golang.org/. Go has its own elegance and programming idioms that make the language productive and fun to code. Go also provides a comprehensive standard library. The standard library provides all the core packages programmers need to build real-world, web and network-based programs. Go is a statically typed, natively compiled, garbage-collected, concurrent programming language that belongs primarily to the C family of languages in terms of basic syntax.</p>&#13;\n<p>The Go Programming Language is an open source project that is distributed under a BSD-style license to make programmers more productive. Go is expressive, concise, clean, and efficient programming language. Go compiles quickly to machine code yet has the convenience of garbage collection and the power of run-time reflection. It's a faster, statically typed, compiled language that feels like a dynamically typed, interpreted language.</p>&#13;\n<p>Go is a compiled language, and like many languages, it makes heavy use of the command line. Go is both the name of the programming language and the name for the toolset used to build and interact with Go programs.</p>&#13;\n<p>Go is a statically typed programming language. What that means is the compiler always wants to know what the type is for every value in the program. When the compiler knows the type information ahead of time, it can help to make sure that the program is working with values in a safe way. This helps to reduce potential memory corruption and bugs, and provides the compiler the opportunity to produce more perform-ant code. Go struct lets you create your own types by combining one or more types, including both built-in and user-defined types. Structs are the only way to create concrete user-defined types in Go. When you create your own types using struct, it is important to understand that Go does not provide support for inheritance in its type system, but it favors composition of types that lets you create larger types by combining smaller types. The design philosophy of Go is to create larger components by combining smaller and modular components. If you are a pragmatic programmer, you will appreciate the design philosophy of Go that favors composition over inheritance because of its practical benefits. The inheritance of types sometimes introduces practical challenges with regard to maintainability.</p>&#13;\n<p>In the last decade, computer hardware has evolved to having many CPU cores and more power. Nowadays we heavily leverage cloud platforms for building and running applications where servers on the cloud have more power. Although modern computers and virtual machine instances on the cloud have more power and many CPU cores, we still can't leverage the power of modern computers using most of the existing programming languages and tools. Concurrency in Go is the ability for functions to run independent of each other. Its concurrency mechanisms make it easy to write programs that get the most out of multi core and networked machines, while its novel type system enables flexible and modular program construction. When a function is created as a goroutine, it's treated as an independent unit of work that gets scheduled and then executed on an available logical processor. Goroutines are created by calling the Go statement followed by the function or method that you want to run as an autonomous activity. The Go run-time scheduler is a sophisticated piece of software that manages all the goroutines that are created and need processor time. The scheduler sits on top of the operating system, binding operating system's threads to logical processors which, in turn, execute goroutines. The scheduler controls everything related to which goroutines are running on which logical processors at any given time.</p>\t<div class=\"hidden\">\n\t\t<span itemprop=\"dateCreated\">2017-03-06T10:55:05+05:30</span>\n\t\t<span itemprop=\" dateModified \">2017-03-06T10:55:05+05:30</span>\n\t\t<span itemprop=\"keywords\">go language tutorial, go vs python, google go game, go language wiki, the go programming language pdf, go language ide, go vs java, go vs c++</span>\n\t\t<span itemprop=\"description\">The Go Programming Language, also commonly referred to as Golang, is a general-purpose programming language, developed by a team at Google.</span>\n\t\t<span itemprop=\"creator\">Amit Arora</span>\n\t\t<span itemprop=\"author\">Amit Arora</span>\n\t\t<span itemprop=\"about\">Go Programming Language Tutorial</span>\n\t\t<span itemprop=\"alternateName\">Golang Tutorial</span>\n\t\t<span itemprop=\"educationalUse\">Programming Tutorial</span>\n\t\t <p itemprop=\"aggregateRating\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/AggregateRating\">\n\t\t   Rated <span itemprop=\"ratingValue\">4.5</span>/5\n\t\t   based on <span itemprop=\"reviewCount\">11</span>\n\t\t </p>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div></body></html>"}, "15429754": {"score": 3, "comments": [], "time": "2017-10-08 23:09:47", "url": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/drsarahbond/2017/10/07/were-pagan-temples-all-smashed-or-just-converted-into-christian-ones/#4439c19b4f9f", "text": "<html><body><div><div _ngcontent-c23=\"\" innerhtml=\"&lt;p&gt;How and why were pagan temples converted into Christian churches in the later Roman empire?

Back in the late 18th century, armchair historian Edward Gibbon provided a view of temple destruction that had lasting repercussions. In his epic work, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=M9QLAAAAYAAJ&amp;amp;rdid=book-M9QLAAAAYAAJ&amp;amp;rdot=1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;he described the tearing down of the Serapeum in Alexandria as illustrative of the empire as a whole. He also described it as a direct assault on Roman idolatry: &amp;quot;The compositions of ancient genius, so many of which have irretrievably perished, might surely have been excepted from the wreck of idolatry for the amusement and instruction of succeeding ages.&amp;quot; As Schuddeboom points out, it was not until much later&amp;nbsp;that historians began to more systematically look at the archaeological remains of pagan temples and to present a reasoning for their destructions.&lt;/p&gt; &#10;&lt;p&gt; &#10; &lt;/p&gt; &#10;&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_2083&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot;&gt; &#10; &lt;div class=&quot;article-body-image&quot;&gt; &#10;  &lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-2083&quot; src=&quot;//blogs-images.forbes.com/drsarahbond/files/2017/10/Gibbon.jpg?width=960&quot; alt=&quot;Wikimed&quot; data-height=&quot;768&quot; data-width=&quot;713&quot; /&gt; &#10;  &lt;small class=&quot;article-photo-credit&quot;&gt;Public Domain &lt;/small&gt; &#10; &lt;/div&gt; &#10; &lt;div article-image-caption=&quot;&quot;&gt; &#10;  &lt;div class=&quot;caption-container&quot; ng-class=&quot;caption_state&quot;&gt; &#10;   &lt;fbs-accordion current=&quot;0&quot;&gt; &#10;    &lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Portrait frontispiece of Edward Gibbon (1737-1794): History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire (W.

I currently work at DB, I can say that they make it look nice from the outside, but when you get here what you find is a large mess. It&#x27;s a big difference between a bank and a company that actually ships software. Most of the work here is done in interfacing systems together, and moving data from one place to another. There is no focus on quality, just patching things together and making them work. This is no surprise when a lot of work is done by contractors hired for 6-12 months. Software and tools are old , but I guess this is a know fact. There is a lot of duplication, there are usually 3-4 systems that can do the same thing, when a high level executive decides that then need to create a new one from scratch. Sure there are exceptions, there are people who work on trading algorithms, but these are rare occasions.<p>These are some of my impressions after some time spent at DB, sorry if it sounds too negativistic.", "This is not only a DB specific, a whole banking industry works like that. Systems that have &lt;10 years are considered new ones. To keep things working, just produce 5x more services created solely to move data from one place to another. No focus on programming discipline or sense of purpose and constant fear to change anything, because that could break things and we have not enough tests or monitoring infrastructure to even detect that. But in finances, IT is not on a focus. After all, we&#x27;re just a &quot;cost center&quot; ;)", "I can underwrite this. I am currently working for a(nother) bank. And I want to add that a lot of the legacy systems, procedures and thought processes stem from the misinterpretation of regulations.<p>When a bank gets a new regulation on their table, they tend to create a department that compartmentalizes the subject within the organisation. That&#x27;s how we get the exact opposite of what the Agile mindset is. And that&#x27;s also how we get organisations where nobody wants to work in, except if the pay or day rates are high enough to excuse any suffering. And that&#x27;s how bad, bloated software is created.", "This is my exact experience while integrating with ERP systems in at least four global firms. Except I&#x27;d change the phrase &quot;not enough tests or monitoring&quot; to &quot;no tests or monitoring except the ones I wrote&quot;.", "This is not banking specific, the whole SW industry works like that. I have worked over 20 years in a couple of companies, where SW was an essential part of our products. Yet the quality has never been good, it&#x27;s a bloat of solving similar problems again and again. Architecture is a mess, even if there are n architects who can present nice diagrams. (I have seen n=1 and n&gt;30, but the fundamental problem is the same)", "To extend my thoughts a bit.<p>Yes, I believe that some sectors might be worse than others. There are metrics and tools provided by the Software Engineering discipline to measure quality of architecture or code. However, they have remained mostly academic. There is no standard metric, which is widely accepted to be useful. And even if some rare(?) company might systematically measure their code base, they don&#x27;t put the results in the their home page and not even in the contract with their customer.<p>As long as that does not change, it&#x27;s just more or less educated feeling where the situation might be better or worse than elsewhere.", "I heard some banks still did crazy things like calculating mortgage payments with spreadsheets.", "Spreadsheets are heavily used in all financial sectors. Personally I&#x27;ve connected many trader developed pricing spreadsheets to etrading systems at investments banks. Last year I was contracting for a large UK mortgage lender who used spreadsheets for all their product dev &amp; spec. Spreadsheets enable bankers to move quicker than bespoke or vendor supplied solutions, hence their enduring popularity.", "I once did some consulting for a very prominent bond fund manager.  His main tool was an excel spreadsheet which was the most godawful mess you can imagine.  Dozens of separate pages with tens to hundreds of thousands of cells each.  I ended up writing some VB code to dump all the formulas into a text file where I could parse them and do some automated analysis (using Common Lisp).  It turned out that the spreadsheet was in fact as much of a train wreck as it appeared to be.  Most of it turned out to be dead code, i.e. &gt;50% (I don&#x27;t remember the exact number) of the cells did not figure into the final result.<p>But the worst part was that there turned out to be a single input that completely dominated the final result, and that input was a &quot;gut feel&quot; that the fund manager had about which way the market was going to move.  So after all that calculation, the upshot was that the fund investment decisions were being made based on this individual&#x27;s intuitions, and the entire spreadsheet was just window dressing.  Ironically, the audience for the window dressing was the fund manager and his team because the spread sheet was considered proprietary, a closely guarded secret.  That&#x27;s the reason I&#x27;m not revealing the name of the manager.  I&#x27;m probably still bound by the terms of the NDA.<p>That was the moment that I realized that much, if not most, of Wall Street is a colossal scam.", "Any complicated spreadsheet might be a bug ridden mess, but at least it&#x27;s one the finance guys understand and can augment themselves.<p>Alternatively they could wait for in-house IT to take a few years and millions of pounds (add going running over schedule and budget, too) to produce a bug ridden mess that misses.", "Programmers tend to look at shitty programs and imagine better ways that it could have been done... In practice the competitor to a shitty program is not a better program, but no program at all.

It was a thrilling, and exhausting, entrepreneurial experience and customers loved it! One catch, we didn\u2019t make any money.\u00a0</p><p>Since then I\u2019ve lived in Europe and USA, claimed a Guinness Book of Record and sold my Silicon Valley Startup. During these adventures in innovation and entrepreneurship, I\u2019ve had my share of hits and misses.\u00a0</p><p>When I reflect on my experiences of designing products and launching them into the world, there are patterns in the efforts that worked. There are four truths I have distilled that are the most holistic, essential rules for success.</p><h1>Rule 1: Great companies build great products</h1><p>People and the way they work together is the starting point for a great company. When teams are communicating well, that usually means clarity and high frequency; their positive energies can come together.</p><p>And culture, the way they hire, retain and grow people, can turbo charge that communication energy and create massive momentum. You know it when you see. A company starts to crush it on a regular basis. It becomes a habit.</p><p>And all of these endeavours add up to something bigger. A mission. A real, meaningful, positive contribution to the world. And that's the platform that launches great products into the world.</p><h1>Rule 2: Growth is a result of solving big customer problems</h1><p>Profits are a result of companies enormous devotion to solving a big problem.</p><p>Don\u2019t solve a small problem. On reflection, a mistake I made too many times. Instead, Search out significant, nasty, hairy problems that seem entrenched. Find a challenge that others are not trying to solve.</p><p>What I've learnt is that solving big problems creates value for the customer. And the customer is always happy to pay for value. And this value exchange means more than a short-term product-market fit. It means room to explore new opportunities in adjunct verticals. But most of all profits give companies the sacred fuel: cash flow.</p><h1>Rule 3: Testing and learning with customers inspires innovation</h1><p>The answer to great products lies with the customers. There\u2019s no excuse for guessing what *might* work.</p><p>Prototyping has been one of the most profound discoveries in my career. Thanks to prototyping expert <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5_h1VuwD6g&amp;vl=en\">Tom Chi</a>. Creating a prototype and testing an idea with customers is the most powerful way to determine how a product can be successful.</p><p>When prototyping under the conditions that feel like real life we create a \u2018direct experience\u2019. The combination of the prototype and all the conditions make the test feel authentic to the customers. Hence, they provide visceral unfiltered, sub-conscious feedback. And this is gold.\u00a0</p><p>Take this feedback and learn from it. And then the real magic begins because you can iterate and test again. And again.\u00a0</p><h1>Rule 4: Tell a story worth sharing</h1><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://startwithwhy.com/\">Start With Why</a> by Simon Sinek is one of my all-time favourite books. It is the best framework I\u2019ve ever used because of its simplicity and breadth of application.\u00a0</p><p>At the heart of his Golden Circle, is this idea: People don\u2019t buy what you do but how and why you do it.\u00a0Here\u2019s an example for Apple.</p><ul><li>What: We make computers</li><li>How: Our products are beautifully designed and easy to use</li><li>Why: We believe in challenging the status quo and doing things differently</li></ul><p>Once you have this idea, you can start by testing with customers. I\u2019ve found this to be a source of great insight. By testing different versions of what/how/why statements I\u2019ve made enormous progress with branding and storytelling before the company or product has even launched.</p><p>And the story will always continue to grow. You'll discover what messages work best. You'll find some channels will deliver better results. And hopefully, you'll find influencers and communities who want to share your story with others.\u00a0</p><p>When creating a new company or product, I advise that you focus equally on product and marketing. And become laser focussed on working with customers throughout the process. This honest, yet hard work, will yield tremendous opportunities.</p><p>And if the team is led by good people, who communicate and hold themselves to a higher standard. Then, you might find yourself enjoying success.</p></div></div></body></html>"}, "15429250": {"score": 1, "comments": [], "time": "2017-10-08 21:15:40", "url": "http://jjjvirtual.blogspot.com/2017/10/malaysia-airlines-offer.html", "text": "<html><body><div><div class=\"post-body entry-content\" id=\"post-body-8105328114832141781\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">\n<div dir=\"ltr\" trbidi=\"on\">\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span><br/></span></p>\n\n\n<p class=\"separator\">\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"separator\">\n<br/></p>\n<p class=\"separator\">\n<br/></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"separator\">\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<br/></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<br/></p>\n\n\n<p class=\"separator\">\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<br/></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<br/></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"separator\">\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<br/></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<br/></p>\n\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<br/></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<br/></p>\n\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<br/></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<br/></p>\n\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<br/></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<br/></p>\n\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<br/></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<br/></p>\n\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"separator\">\n<br/></p>\n<p class=\"separator\">\n<br/></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"separator\">\n<br/></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span><br/></span></p>\n<p class=\"separator\">\n_________________________________________________________________________________</p>\n<p class=\"separator\">\n<br/></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<br/></p>\n\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<br/></p>\n\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<br/></p>\n\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<br/></p>\n\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<br/></p>\n\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<br/></p>\n\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<br/></p>\n\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<br/></p>\n\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<br/></p>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>Involve Asia Publisher referral\nprogram (CPA)<p/></span></div>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<br/></p>\n\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<br/></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<br/></p>\n\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<br/></p>\n\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<br/></p>\n\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<br/></p>\n\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<br/></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<br/></p>\n\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<br/></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<br/></p>\n\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<br/></p>\n\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<br/></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<br/></p>\n\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<br/></p>\n\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<br/></p>\n\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<br/></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<br/></p>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>Valued Opinions (HK) English<p/></span></div>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<br/></p>\n\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<br/></p>\n\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<br/></p>\n\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<br/></p>\n\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<br/></p>\n\n<p class=\"separator\">\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"separator\">\n<br/></p>\n<p class=\"separator\">\n<br/></p>\n<p class=\"separator\">\n<br/></p>\n</div>\n<p/>\n</div>\n</div></body></html>"}, "15430787": {"score": 1, "comments": [], "time": "2017-10-09 03:26:52", "url": "https://mobile.nytimes.com/2011/06/26/magazine/my-life-as-an-undocumented-immigrant.html", "text": "<html><body><div><div class=\"article-body\"><p class=\"p-block\">One August morning nearly two decades ago, my mother woke me and put me in a cab. She handed me a jacket. \u201c<em>Baka malamig doon</em>\u201d were among the few words she said. (\u201cIt might be cold there.\u201d) When I arrived at the Philippines\u2019 Ninoy Aquino International Airport with her, my aunt and a family friend, I was introduced to a man I\u2019d never seen. They told me he was my uncle. He held my hand as I boarded an airplane for the first time. It was 1993, and I was 12.</p><p class=\"p-block\">My mother wanted to give me a better life, so she sent me thousands of miles away to live with her parents in America \u2014 my grandfather (<em>Lolo</em> in Tagalog) and grandmother (<em>Lola</em>). After I arrived in Mountain View, Calif., in the San Francisco Bay Area, I entered sixth grade and quickly grew to love my new home, family and culture. I discovered a passion for language, though it was hard to learn the difference between formal English and American slang. One of my early memories is of a freckled kid in middle school asking me, \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d I replied, \u201cThe sky,\u201d and he and a couple of other kids laughed. I won the eighth-grade spelling bee by memorizing words I couldn\u2019t properly pronounce. (The winning word was \u201cindefatigable.\u201d)</p><p class=\"p-block\">One day when I was 16, I rode my bike to the nearby D.M.V. office to get my driver\u2019s permit. Some of my friends already had their licenses, so I figured it was time. But when I handed the clerk my green card as proof of U.S. residency, she flipped it around, examining it. \u201cThis is fake,\u201d she whispered. \u201cDon\u2019t come back here again.\u201d</p><p class=\"p-block\">Confused and scared, I pedaled home and confronted Lolo. I remember him sitting in the garage, cutting coupons. I dropped my bike and ran over to him, showing him the green card. \u201c<em>Peke ba ito</em>?\u201d I asked in Tagalog. (\u201cIs this fake?\u201d) My grandparents were naturalized American citizens \u2014 he worked as a security guard, she as a food server \u2014 and they had begun supporting my mother and me financially when I was 3, after my father\u2019s wandering eye and inability to properly provide for us led to my parents\u2019 separation. Lolo was a proud man, and I saw the shame on his face as he told me he purchased the card, along with other fake documents, for me. \u201cDon\u2019t show it to other people,\u201d he warned.</p><p class=\"a-ok-V1\" data-pn=\"4\"/><p class=\"p-block\">I decided then that I could never give anyone reason to doubt I was an American. I convinced myself that if I worked enough, if I achieved enough, I would be rewarded with citizenship. I felt I could earn it.</p><p class=\"a-ok-V2\" data-pn=\"5\"/><p class=\"p-block\">I\u2019ve tried. Over the past 14 years, I\u2019ve graduated from high school and college and built a career as a journalist, interviewing some of the most famous people in the country. On the surface, I\u2019ve created a good life. I\u2019ve lived the American dream.</p><p class=\"p-block\">But I am still an undocumented immigrant. And that means living a different kind of reality. It means going about my day in fear of being found out. It means rarely trusting people, even those closest to me, with who I really am. It means keeping my family photos in a shoebox rather than displaying them on shelves in my home, so friends don\u2019t ask about them. It means reluctantly, even painfully, doing things I know are wrong and unlawful. And it has meant relying on a sort of 21st-century underground railroad of supporters, people who took an interest in my future and took risks for me.</p><p class=\"p-block\">Last year I read about four students who walked from Miami to Washington to lobby for the Dream Act, a nearly decade-old immigration bill that would provide a path to legal permanent residency for young people who have been educated in this country. At the risk of deportation \u2014 the Obama administration has deported almost 800,000 people in the last two years \u2014 they are speaking out. Their courage has inspired me.</p><p class=\"p-block\">There are believed to be 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States. We\u2019re not always who you think we are. Some pick your strawberries or care for your children. Some are in high school or college. And some, it turns out, write news articles you might read. I grew up here. This is my home. Yet even though I think of myself as an American and consider America my country, my country doesn\u2019t think of me as one of its own.</p><p class=\"p-block\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"p-block\"><strong>My first challenge</strong> was the language. Though I learned English in the Philippines, I wanted to lose my accent. During high school, I spent hours at a time watching television (especially \u201cFrasier,\u201d \u201cHome Improvement\u201d and reruns of \u201cThe Golden Girls\u201d) and movies (from \u201cGoodfellas\u201d to \u201cAnne of Green Gables\u201d), pausing the VHS to try to copy how various characters enunciated their words. At the local library, I read magazines, books and newspapers \u2014 anything to learn how to write better. Kathy Dewar, my high-school English teacher, introduced me to journalism. From the moment I wrote my first article for the student paper, I convinced myself that having my name in print \u2014 writing in English, interviewing Americans \u2014 validated my presence here.</p><p class=\"p-block\">The debates over \u201cillegal aliens\u201d intensified my anxieties. In 1994, only a year after my flight from the Philippines, Gov. Pete Wilson was re-elected in part because of his support for Proposition 187, which prohibited undocumented immigrants from attending public school and accessing other services. (A federal court later found the law unconstitutional.) After my encounter at the D.M.V. in 1997, I grew more aware of anti-immigrant sentiments and stereotypes: <em>they don\u2019t want to assimilate, they are a drain on society. </em>They\u2019re not talking about me, I would tell myself. I have something to contribute.</p><p class=\"a-ok-V1\" data-pn=\"12\"/><p class=\"p-block\">To do that, I had to work \u2014 and for that, I needed a <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/s/social_security_us/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier\" title=\"More articles about Social Security.\" class=\"meta-classifier\">Social Security</a> number. Fortunately, my grandfather had already managed to get one for me. Lolo had always taken care of everyone in the family. He and my grandmother emigrated legally in 1984 from Zambales, a province in the Philippines of rice fields and bamboo houses\u00ad, following Lolo\u2019s sister, who married a Filipino-American serving in the American military. She petitioned for her brother and his wife to join her. When they got here, Lolo petitioned for his two children \u2014 my mother and her younger brother \u2014 to follow them. But instead of mentioning that my mother was a married woman, he listed her as single. Legal residents can\u2019t petition for their married children. Besides, Lolo didn\u2019t care for my father. He didn\u2019t want him coming here too.</p><p class=\"a-ok-V2\" data-pn=\"13\"/><p class=\"p-block\">But soon Lolo grew nervous that the immigration authorities reviewing the petition would discover my mother was married, thus derailing not only her chances of coming here but those of my uncle as well. So he withdrew her petition. After my uncle came to America legally in 1991, Lolo tried to get my mother here through a tourist visa, but she wasn\u2019t able to obtain one. That\u2019s when she decided to send me. My mother told me later that she figured she would follow me soon. She never did.</p><p class=\"p-block\">The \u201cuncle\u201d who brought me here turned out to be a coyote, not a relative, my grandfather later explained. Lolo scraped together enough money \u2014 I eventually learned it was $4,500, a huge sum for him \u2014 to pay him to smuggle me here under a fake name and fake passport. (I never saw the passport again after the flight and have always assumed that the coyote kept it.) After I arrived in America, Lolo obtained a new fake Filipino passport, in my real name this time, adorned with a fake student visa, in addition to the fraudulent green card.</p><p class=\"p-block\">Using the fake passport, we went to the local Social Security Administration office and applied for a Social Security number and card. It was, I remember, a quick visit. When the card came in the mail, it had my full, real name, but it also clearly stated: \u201cValid for work only with I.N.S. authorization.\u201d</p><p class=\"p-block\">When I began looking for work, a short time after the D.M.V. incident, my grandfather and I took the Social Security card to Kinko\u2019s, where he covered the \u201cI.N.S. authorization\u201d text with a sliver of white tape. We then made photocopies of the card. At a glance, at least, the copies would look like copies of a regular, unrestricted Social Security card.</p><p class=\"p-block\">Lolo always imagined I would work the kind of low-paying jobs that undocumented people often take. (Once I married an American, he said, I would get my real papers, and everything would be fine.) But even menial jobs require documents, so he and I hoped the doctored card would work for now. The more documents I had, he said, the better.</p><p class=\"p-block\">While in high school, I worked part time at Subway, then at the front desk of the local Y.M.C.A., then at a tennis club, until I landed an unpaid internship at The Mountain View Voice, my hometown newspaper. First I brought coffee and helped around the office; eventually I began covering city-hall meetings and other assignments for pay.</p><p class=\"a-ok-V1\" data-pn=\"19\"/><p class=\"p-block\">For more than a decade of getting part-time and full-time jobs, employers have rarely asked to check my original Social Security card. When they did, I showed the photocopied version, which they accepted. Over time, I also began checking the citizenship box on my federal I-9 employment eligibility forms. (Claiming full citizenship was actually easier than declaring permanent resident \u201cgreen card\u201d status, which would have required me to provide an alien registration number.)</p><p class=\"a-ok-V2\" data-pn=\"20\"/><p class=\"p-block\">This deceit never got easier. The more I did it, the more I felt like an impostor, the more guilt I carried \u2014 and the more I worried that I would get caught. But I kept doing it. I needed to live and survive on my own, and I decided this was the way.</p><p class=\"p-block\">Mountain View High School became my second home. I was elected to represent my school at school-board meetings, which gave me the chance to meet and befriend Rich Fischer, the superintendent for our school district. I joined the speech and debate team, acted in school plays and eventually became co-editor of The Oracle, the student newspaper. That drew the attention of my principal, Pat Hyland. \u201cYou\u2019re at school just as much as I am,\u201d she told me. Pat and Rich would soon become mentors, and over time, almost surrogate parents for me.</p><p class=\"p-block\">After a choir rehearsal during my junior year, Jill Denny, the choir director, told me she was considering a Japan trip for our singing group. I told her I couldn\u2019t afford it, but she said we\u2019d figure out a way. I hesitated, and then decided to tell her the truth. \u201cIt\u2019s not really the money,\u201d I remember saying. \u201cI don\u2019t have the right passport.\u201d When she assured me we\u2019d get the proper documents, I finally told her. \u201cI can\u2019t get the right passport,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m not supposed to be here.\u201d</p><p class=\"p-block\">She understood. So the choir toured Hawaii instead, with me in tow. (Mrs. Denny and I spoke a couple of months ago, and she told me she hadn\u2019t wanted to leave any student behind.)</p><p class=\"p-block\">Later that school year, my history class watched a documentary on Harvey Milk, the openly gay San Francisco city official who was assassinated. This was 1999, just six months after Matthew Shepard\u2019s body was found tied to a fence in Wyoming. During the discussion, I raised my hand and said something like: \u201cI\u2019m sorry Harvey Milk got killed for being gay. . . . I\u2019ve been meaning to say this. . . . I\u2019m gay.\u201d</p><p class=\"a-ok-V1\" data-pn=\"25\"/><p class=\"p-block\">I hadn\u2019t planned on coming out that morning, though I had known that I was gay for several years. With that announcement, I became the only openly gay student at school, and it caused turmoil with my grandparents. Lolo kicked me out of the house for a few weeks. Though we eventually reconciled, I had disappointed him on two fronts. First, as a Catholic, he considered homosexuality a sin and was embarrassed about having \u201c<em>ang apo na bakla</em>\u201d (\u201ca grandson who is gay\u201d). Even worse, I was making matters more difficult for myself, he said. I needed to marry an American woman in order to gain a green card.</p><p class=\"a-ok-V2\" data-pn=\"26\"/><p class=\"p-block\">Tough as it was, coming out about being gay seemed less daunting than coming out about my legal status. I kept my other secret mostly hidden.</p><p class=\"p-block\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"p-block\"><strong>While my classmates</strong> awaited their college acceptance letters, I hoped to get a full-time job at The Mountain View Voice after graduation. It\u2019s not that I didn\u2019t want to go to college, but I couldn\u2019t apply for state and federal financial aid. Without that, my family couldn\u2019t afford to send me.</p><p class=\"p-block\">But when I finally told Pat and Rich about my immigration \u201cproblem\u201d \u2014 as we called it from then on \u2014 they helped me look for a solution. At first, they even wondered if one of them could adopt me and fix the situation that way, but a lawyer Rich consulted told him it wouldn\u2019t change my legal status because I was too old. Eventually they connected me to a new scholarship fund for high-potential students who were usually the first in their families to attend college. Most important, the fund was not concerned with immigration status. I was among the first recipients, with the scholarship covering tuition, lodging, books and other expenses for my studies at San Francisco State University.</p><p class=\"p-block\">As a college freshman, I found a job working part time at The San Francisco Chronicle, where I sorted mail and wrote some freelance articles. My ambition was to get a reporting job, so I embarked on a series of internships. First I landed at The Philadelphia Daily News, in the summer of 2001, where I covered a drive-by shooting and the wedding of the 76ers star Allen Iverson. Using those articles, I applied to The Seattle Times and got an internship for the following summer.</p><p class=\"p-block\">But then my lack of proper documents became a problem again. The Times\u2019s recruiter, Pat Foote, asked all incoming interns to bring certain paperwork on their first day: a birth certificate, or a passport, or a driver\u2019s license plus an original Social Security card. I panicked, thinking my documents wouldn\u2019t pass muster. So before starting the job, I called Pat and told her about my legal status. After consulting with management, she called me back with the answer I feared: I couldn\u2019t do the internship.</p><p class=\"p-block\">This was devastating. What good was college if I couldn\u2019t then pursue the career I wanted? I decided then that if I was to succeed in a profession that is all about truth-telling, I couldn\u2019t tell the truth about myself.</p><p class=\"a-ok-V1\" data-pn=\"33\"/><p class=\"p-block\">After this episode, Jim Strand, the venture capitalist who sponsored my scholarship, offered to pay for an immigration lawyer. Rich and I went to meet her in San Francisco\u2019s financial district.</p><p class=\"a-ok-V2\" data-pn=\"34\"/><p class=\"p-block\">I was hopeful. This was in early 2002, shortly after Senators Orrin Hatch, the Utah Republican, and Dick Durbin, the Illinois Democrat, introduced the Dream Act \u2014 Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors. It seemed like the legislative version of what I\u2019d told myself: If I work hard and contribute, things will work out.</p><p class=\"p-block\">But the meeting left me crushed. My only solution, the lawyer said, was to go back to the Philippines and accept a 10-year ban before I could apply to return legally.</p><p class=\"p-block\">If Rich was discouraged, he hid it well. \u201cPut this problem on a shelf,\u201d he told me. \u201cCompartmentalize it. Keep going.\u201d</p><p class=\"p-block\">And I did. For the summer of 2003, I applied for internships across the country. Several newspapers, including The Wall Street Journal, The Boston Globe and The Chicago Tribune, expressed interest. But when The Washington Post offered me a spot, I knew where I would go. And this time, I had no intention of acknowledging my \u201cproblem.\u201d</p><p class=\"p-block\">The Post internship posed a tricky obstacle: It required a driver\u2019s license. (After my close call at the California D.M.V., I\u2019d never gotten one.) So I spent an afternoon at The Mountain View Public Library, studying various states\u2019 requirements. Oregon was among the most welcoming \u2014 and it was just a few hours\u2019 drive north.</p><p class=\"p-block\">Again, my support network came through. A friend\u2019s father lived in Portland, and he allowed me to use his address as proof of residency. Pat, Rich and Rich\u2019s longtime assistant, Mary Moore, sent letters to me at that address. Rich taught me how to do three-point turns in a parking lot, and a friend accompanied me to Portland.</p><p class=\"a-ok-V1\" data-pn=\"40\"/><p class=\"p-block\">The license meant everything to me \u2014 it would let me drive, fly and work. But my grandparents worried about the Portland trip and the Washington internship. While Lola offered daily prayers so that I would not get caught, Lolo told me that I was dreaming too big, risking too much.</p><p class=\"a-ok-V2\" data-pn=\"41\"/><p class=\"p-block\">I was determined to pursue my ambitions. I was 22, I told them, responsible for my own actions. But this was different from Lolo\u2019s driving a confused teenager to Kinko\u2019s. I knew what I was doing now, and I knew it wasn\u2019t right. But what was I supposed to do?</p><p class=\"p-block\">I was paying state and federal taxes, but I was using an invalid Social Security card and writing false information on my employment forms. But that seemed better than depending on my grandparents or on Pat, Rich and Jim \u2014 or returning to a country I barely remembered. I convinced myself all would be O.K. if I lived up to the qualities of a \u201ccitizen\u201d: hard work, self-reliance, love of my country.</p><p class=\"p-block\">At the D.M.V. in Portland, I arrived with my photocopied Social Security card, my college I.D., a pay stub from The San Francisco Chronicle and my proof of state residence \u2014 the letters to the Portland address that my support network had sent. It worked. My license, issued in 2003, was set to expire eight years later, on my 30th birthday, on Feb. 3, 2011. I had eight years to succeed professionally, and to hope that some sort of immigration reform would pass in the meantime and allow me to stay.</p><p class=\"p-block\">It seemed like all the time in the world.</p><p class=\"p-block\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"p-block\"><strong>My summer in</strong> Washington was exhilarating. I was intimidated to be in a major newsroom but was assigned a mentor \u2014 Peter Perl, a veteran magazine writer \u2014 to help me navigate it. A few weeks into the internship, he printed out one of my articles, about a guy who recovered a long-lost wallet, circled the first two paragraphs and left it on my desk. \u201cGreat eye for details \u2014 awesome!\u201d he wrote. Though I didn\u2019t know it then, Peter would become one more member of my network.</p><p class=\"p-block\">At the end of the summer, I returned to The San Francisco Chronicle. My plan was to finish school \u2014 I was now a senior \u2014 while I worked for The Chronicle as a reporter for the city desk. But when The Post beckoned again, offering me a full-time, two-year paid internship that I could start when I graduated in June 2004, it was too tempting to pass up. I moved back to Washington.</p><p class=\"p-block\">About four months into my job as a reporter for The Post, I began feeling increasingly paranoid, as if I had \u201cillegal immigrant\u201d tattooed on my forehead \u2014 and in Washington, of all places, where the debates over immigration seemed never-ending. I was so eager to prove myself that I feared I was annoying some colleagues and editors \u2014 and worried that any one of these professional journalists could discover my secret. The anxiety was nearly paralyzing. I decided I had to tell one of the higher-ups about my situation. I turned to Peter.</p><p class=\"a-ok-V1\" data-pn=\"49\"/><p class=\"p-block\">By this time, Peter, who still works at The Post, had become part of management as the paper\u2019s director of newsroom training and professional development. One afternoon in late October, we walked a couple of blocks to Lafayette Square, across from the White House. Over some 20 minutes, sitting on a bench, I told him everything: the Social Security card, the driver\u2019s license, Pat and Rich, my family.</p><p class=\"a-ok-V2\" data-pn=\"50\"/><p class=\"p-block\">Peter was shocked. \u201cI understand you 100 times better now,\u201d he said. He told me that I had done the right thing by telling him, and that it was now our shared problem. He said he didn\u2019t want to do anything about it just yet. I had just been hired, he said, and I needed to prove myself. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve done enough,\u201d he said, \u201cwe\u2019ll tell Don and Len together.\u201d (Don Graham is the chairman of The Washington Post Company; Leonard Downie Jr. was then the paper\u2019s executive editor.) A month later, I spent my first Thanksgiving in Washington with Peter and his family.</p><p class=\"p-block\">In the five years that followed, I did my best to \u201cdo enough.\u201d I was promoted to staff writer, reported on video-game culture, wrote a series on Washington\u2019s H.I.V./AIDS epidemic and covered the role of technology and social media in the 2008 presidential race. I visited the White House, where I interviewed senior aides and covered a state dinner \u2014 and gave the Secret Service the Social Security number I obtained with false documents.</p><p class=\"p-block\">I did my best to steer clear of reporting on immigration policy but couldn\u2019t always avoid it. On two occasions, I wrote about Hillary Clinton\u2019s position on driver\u2019s licenses for undocumented immigrants. I also wrote an article about Senator Mel Martinez of Florida, then the chairman of the Republican National Committee, who was defending his party\u2019s stance toward Latinos after only one Republican presidential candidate \u2014 John McCain, the co-author of a failed immigration bill \u2014 agreed to participate in a debate sponsored by Univision, the Spanish-language network.</p><p class=\"p-block\">It was an odd sort of dance: I was trying to stand out in a highly competitive newsroom, yet I was terrified that if I stood out too much, I\u2019d invite unwanted scrutiny. I tried to compartmentalize my fears, distract myself by reporting on the lives of other people, but there was no escaping the central conflict in my life. Maintaining a deception for so long distorts your sense of self. You start wondering who you\u2019ve become, and why.</p><p class=\"p-block\">In April 2008, I was part of a Post team that won a <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/p/pulitzer_prizes/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier\" title=\"More articles about the Pulitzer Prizes.\" class=\"meta-classifier\">Pulitzer Prize</a> for the paper\u2019s coverage of the Virginia Tech shootings a year earlier. Lolo died a year earlier, so it was Lola who called me the day of the announcement. The first thing she said was, \u201c<em>Anong mangyayari kung malaman ng mga tao</em>?\u201d</p><p class=\"a-ok-V1\" data-pn=\"55\"/><p class=\"p-block\">What will happen if people find out?</p><p class=\"p-block\">I couldn\u2019t say anything. After we got off the phone, I rushed to the bathroom on the fourth floor of the newsroom, sat down on the toilet and cried.</p><p class=\"a-ok-V2\" data-pn=\"57\"/><p class=\"p-block\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"p-block\"><strong>In the summer</strong> of 2009, without ever having had that follow-up talk with top Post management, I left the paper and moved to New York to join The Huffington Post. I met Arianna Huffington at a Washington Press Club Foundation dinner I was covering for The Post two years earlier, and she later recruited me to join her news site. I wanted to learn more about Web publishing, and I thought the new job would provide a useful education.</p><p class=\"p-block\">Still, I was apprehensive about the move: many companies were already using E-Verify, a program set up by the Department of Homeland Security that checks if prospective employees are eligible to work, and I didn\u2019t know if my new employer was among them. But I\u2019d been able to get jobs in other newsrooms, I figured, so I filled out the paperwork as usual and succeeded in landing on the payroll.</p><p class=\"p-block\">While I worked at The Huffington Post, other opportunities emerged. My H.I.V./AIDS series became a documentary film called \u201cThe Other City,\u201d which opened at the <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/t/tribeca_film_festival_nyc/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier\" title=\"More articles about the Tribeca Film Festival.\" class=\"meta-classifier\">Tribeca Film Festival</a> last year and was broadcast on Showtime. I began writing for magazines and landed a dream assignment: profiling Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg for The New Yorker.</p><p class=\"p-block\">The more I achieved, the more scared and depressed I became. I was proud of my work, but there was always a cloud hanging over it, over me. My old eight-year deadline \u2014 the expiration of my Oregon driver\u2019s license \u2014 was approaching.</p><p class=\"p-block\">After slightly less than a year, I decided to leave The Huffington Post. In part, this was because I wanted to promote the documentary and write a book about online culture \u2014 or so I told my friends. But the real reason was, after so many years of trying to be a part of the system, of focusing all my energy on my professional life, I learned that no amount of professional success would solve my problem or ease the sense of loss and displacement I felt. I lied to a friend about why I couldn\u2019t take a weekend trip to Mexico. Another time I concocted an excuse for why I couldn\u2019t go on an all-expenses-paid trip to Switzerland. I have been unwilling, for years, to be in a long-term relationship because I never wanted anyone to get too close and ask too many questions. All the while, Lola\u2019s question was stuck in my head: What will happen if people find out?</p><p class=\"p-block\">Early this year, just two weeks before my 30th birthday, I won a small reprieve: I obtained a driver\u2019s license in the state of Washington. The license is valid until 2016. This offered me five more years of acceptable identification \u2014 but also five more years of fear, of lying to people I respect and institutions that trusted me, of running away from who I am.</p><p class=\"a-ok-V1\" data-pn=\"64\"/><p class=\"p-block\">I\u2019m done running. I\u2019m exhausted. I don\u2019t want that life anymore.</p><p class=\"p-block\">So I\u2019ve decided to come forward, own up to what I\u2019ve done, and tell my story to the best of my recollection. I\u2019ve reached out to former bosses\u00ad and employers and apologized for misleading them \u2014 a mix of humiliation and liberation coming with each disclosure. All the people mentioned in this article gave me permission to use their names. I\u2019ve also talked to family and friends about my situation and am working with legal counsel to review my options. I don\u2019t know what the consequences will be of telling my story.</p><p class=\"a-ok-V2\" data-pn=\"66\"/><p class=\"p-block\">I do know that I am grateful to my grandparents, my Lolo and Lola, for giving me the chance for a better life. I\u2019m also grateful to my other family \u2014 the support network I found here in America \u2014 for encouraging me to pursue my dreams.</p><p class=\"p-block\">It\u2019s been almost 18 years since I\u2019ve seen my mother. Early on, I was mad at her for putting me in this position, and then mad at myself for being angry and ungrateful. By the time I got to college, we rarely spoke by phone. It became too painful; after a while it was easier to just send money to help support her and my two half-siblings. My sister, almost 2 years old when I left, is almost 20 now. I\u2019ve never met my 14-year-old brother. I would love to see them.</p><p class=\"p-block\">Not long ago, I called my mother. I wanted to fill the gaps in my memory about that August morning so many years ago. We had never discussed it. Part of me wanted to shove the memory aside, but to write this article and face the facts of my life, I needed more details. Did I cry? Did she? Did we kiss goodbye?</p><p class=\"p-block\">My mother told me I was excited about meeting a stewardess, about getting on a plane. She also reminded me of the one piece of advice she gave me for blending in: If anyone asked why I was coming to America, I should say I was going to Disneyland.</p><div class=\"story-footer\"><div class=\"story-meta\"><div class=\"article-tagline\"><p>Jose Antonio Vargas (Jose@DefineAmerican.com) is a former reporter for The Washington Post and shared a Pulitzer Prize for coverage of the Virginia Tech shootings.

The project, called Hands Free Hectare, was completed last month with a yield of 4 1/2 tons of barley, according to news releases.</p><p class=\"zn-body__paragraph speakable\">The automated farm was a joint venture by Harper Adams University in Shropshire, England, and Precision Decisions, a farming specialist company in York. </p><p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"Previously, people have automated sections of agricultural systems, but funding and interest generally only goes towards one single area,\" said Kit Franklin, an agricultural engineer on the project. </p><p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Experts agree that automation technology has been available for some time now, but in recent years its implementation has been accelerated by decreasing costs and changing demographics in the workforce.</p><div class=\"zn-body__read-all\"><p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"The rising cost of labor is a huge driver in the field of agriculture technology,\" explained Matt Nielsen of Autonomous Solutions, a Utah-based company that converts vehicles from manual to robotic control. \"It makes sense when you compare the cost of technology to the cost of labor.\"</p><p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\"><h3>Harbinger of what's possible</h3></p><p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">However, there are limitations still to be assessed. For example, fresh fruits and vegetables are more delicate than sturdy grains and may be more susceptible to bruising in a harvest void of human touch.</p><p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">There are also social and country-specific considerations. In Japan, for instance, agricultural automation may be a necessity; in India, it could mean unemployment for millions. </p><p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"Technically, complete automation is feasible everywhere, but economically and socially it only makes sense in certain situations,\" said David Zilberman, a professor of agricultural and resource economics at the University of California, Berkeley.</p><p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Nonetheless, the complete mechanization accomplished in the UK is a harbinger of what's possible in agriculture production, according to experts.</p><p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">At Hands Free Hectare, agronomists and engineers used customized tractors and drones to cultivate the barley from an area roughly equivalent to two and a half acres.   </p><p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Drones with multispectral sensors took aerial images of the field, while smaller machines at crop level took samples to assess what fertilizers to apply and where.

The whole enterprise cost around $250,000, Innovate UK said in a statement.</p><p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"The project itself was incredibly good value for money,\" said Martin Abell, a mechatronics researcher at Precision Decisions. \"This was only possible through the use of open-source software, allowing us to program our vehicles through low-cost drone-based autopilots.\"</p><p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\"><h3>Skill set shift</h3></p><p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Researchers maintain that even machinery produced commercially -- as opposed to the prototypes used at Hands Free Hectare -- would be priced comparatively to traditional agricultural equipment. </p><p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"Just as computers used to be expensive, the cost of automation technology is decreasing and won't be a barrier for even small farms,\" explained Michael Boehlje, a professor of agricultural economics at Purdue University. </p><p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Hands Free Hectare says the project is not about putting farmers out of work but instead modernizing their position. </p><p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"A change in skill set is inevitable,\" said Abell. \"Roles would transition, enabling the farmers to better use their time managing their farm and crops, opposed to carrying out the seemingly robotic task of driving up and down a field in a straight line.\"</p><p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">By leaving the \"robotic\" jobs to the robots, agriculturalists say farmers could create more efficient work-flows free of burdensome labor.</p><p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"A farmer once told me he adopted robotic farming systems so he could have a life,\" recalled Boehlje.</p><p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">With the success of the summer harvest, Hands Free Hectare plans to continue its research into farming without any human tillage.

One-shot containers accomplishes a particular task and stops. Long running containers runs for an indefinite period till it either gets stopped by the user or when the root process inside container crashes. It is necessary to gracefully handle container\u2019s death and to make sure that the Job running as container does not get impacted in an unexpected manner. When containers are run with Swarm orchestration, Swarm monitors the containers health, exit status and the entire lifecycle including upgrade and rollback. This will be a pretty long blog. I did not want to split it since it makes sense to look at this holistically. You can jump to specific sections by clicking on the links below if needed. In this blog, I will cover the following topics with examples:</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"signalexit\">Handling Signals and exit codes</h3>\n<p>When we pass a signal to container using Docker CLI, Docker passes the signal to the main process running inside container(PID-1). This <a href=\"http://www.comptechdoc.org/os/linux/programming/linux_pgsignals.html\">link </a>has the list of all Linux signals. <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#exit-status\">Docker exit codes</a> follow the <a href=\"http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/exitcodes.html\">chroot exit standard</a> for Docker defined exit codes. Other standard exit codes can come from the program running inside container. Container exit code can be seen from container events coming from Docker daemon when the container exits. For containers that have not been cleaned up, exit code can be found from \u201cdocker ps -a\u201d.<br/>\nFollowing is a sample \u201cdocker ps -a\u201d output where nginx container exited with exit code 0. Here, I used \u201cdocker stop\u201d to stop the container.</p>\n<pre>$ docker ps -a\nCONTAINER ID        IMAGE                  COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS                       PORTS               NAMES\n32d675260384        nginx                  \"nginx -g 'daemon ...\"   18 seconds ago      <strong>Exited (0)</strong> 7 seconds ago                         web\n</pre>\n<p>Following is a sample \u201cdocker ps -a\u201d output where nginx container exited with exit code 137. Here, I used \u201cdocker kill\u201d to stop the container.</p>\n<pre>$ docker ps -a\nCONTAINER ID        IMAGE                  COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS                       PORTS               NAMES\n9b5d8348cb89        nginx                  \"nginx -g 'daemon ...\"   11 seconds ago      <strong>Exited (137)</strong> 2 seconds ago                       web\n</pre>\n<p>Following is the list of standard and Docker defined exit codes:</p>\n<pre>0: Success\n125: Docker run itself fails\n126: Contained command cannot be invoked\n127: Containerd command cannot be found\n128 + n: Fatal error signal n:\n130: (128+2) Container terminated by Control-C\n137: (128+9) Container received a SIGKILL\n143: (128+15) Container received a SIGTERM\n255: Exit status out of range(-1)\n</pre>\n<p>Following is a simple Python program that handles Signals. This program will be run as Docker container to illustrate Docker signals and exit codes.</p>\n<pre>#!/usr/bin/python\n\nimport sys\nimport signal\nimport time\n\ndef signal_handler_int(sigid, frame):\n    print \"signal\", sigid, \",\", \"Handling Ctrl+C/SIGINT!\"\n    sys.exit(signal.SIGINT)\n\ndef signal_handler_term(sigid, frame):\n    print \"signal\", sigid, \",\", \"Handling SIGTERM!\"\n    sys.exit(signal.SIGTERM)\n\ndef signal_handler_usr(sigid, frame):\n    print \"signal\", sigid, \",\", \"Handling SIGUSR1!\"\n    sys.exit(0)\n\ndef main():\n    # Register signal handler\n    signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, signal_handler_int)\n    signal.signal(signal.SIGTERM, signal_handler_term)\n    signal.signal(signal.SIGUSR1, signal_handler_usr)\n\n    while True:\n        print \"I am alive\"\n        sys.stdout.flush()\n        time.sleep(1)\n\n# This is the standard boilerplate that calls the main() function.\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n</pre>\n<p>Following is the Dockerfile to convert this to container:</p>\n<pre>FROM python:2.7\nCOPY ./signalexample.py ./signalexample.py\nENTRYPOINT [\"python\", \"signalexample.py\"]\n</pre>\n<p>Lets build the container:</p>\n<pre>docker build --no-cache -t smakam/signaltest:v1 .\n</pre>\n<p>Lets start the container:</p>\n<pre>docker run -d --name signaltest smakam/signaltest:v1 \n</pre>\n<p>We can watch the logs from container using docker logs:</p>\n<pre>docker logs -f signaltest\n</pre>\n<p>The Python program above handles SIGINT, SIGTERM and SIGUSR1. We can pass these signals to the container using Docker CLI.<br/>\nFollowing command sends SIGINT to the container:</p>\n<pre>docker kill --signal=SIGINT signaltest\n</pre>\n<p>In the Docker logs, we can see the following to show that this signal is handled:</p>\n<pre>signal 2 , Handling Ctrl+C/SIGINT!\n</pre>\n<p>Following output shows the container exit status:</p>\n<pre>$ docker ps -a\nCONTAINER ID        IMAGE                  COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS                     PORTS               NAMES\nc06266e79a43        smakam/signaltest:v1   \"python signalexam...\"   36 seconds ago      Exited (2) 3 seconds ago                       signaltest\n</pre>\n<p>Following command sends SIGTERM to the container:</p>\n<pre>docker kill --signal=SIGTERM signaltest\n</pre>\n<p>In the Docker logs, we can see the following to show that this signal is handled:</p>\n<pre>signal 15 , Handling SIGTERM!\n</pre>\n<p>Following output shows the container exit status:</p>\n<pre>$ docker ps -a\nCONTAINER ID        IMAGE                  COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS                      PORTS               NAMES\n0149708f42b2        smakam/signaltest:v1   \"python signalexam...\"   10 seconds ago      Exited (15) 2 seconds ago                       signaltest\n</pre>\n<p>Following command sends SIGUSR1 to the container:</p>\n<pre>docker kill --signal=SIGUSR1 signaltest\n</pre>\n<p>In the Docker logs, we can see the following to show that this signal is handled:</p>\n<pre>signal 15 , Handling SIGUSR1!\n</pre>\n<p>Following output shows the container exit status:</p>\n<pre>$ docker ps -a\nCONTAINER ID        IMAGE                  COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS                     PORTS               NAMES\nc92f7b4dd45b        smakam/signaltest:v1   \"python signalexam...\"   12 seconds ago      Exited (0) 2 seconds ago                       signaltest\n</pre>\n<p>When we execute \u201cdocker stop \u201c, Docker first sends SIGTERM signal to the container, waits for some time and then sends SIGKILL. This is done so that the program executing inside the container can use the SIGTERM signal to do the graceful shutdown of the program.</p>\n<h4>Common mistake in Docker signal handling</h4>\n<p>In the above example, the python program runs as PID 1 inside container since we used the EXEC form of ENTRYPOINT in Dockerfile. If we use the background method of ENTRYPOINT, shell process runs as PID 1 and the python program runs as another process. Following is a sample Dockerfile for starting the program as background process.</p>\n<pre>FROM python:2.7\nCOPY ./signalexample.py ./signalexample.py\nENTRYPOINT python signalexample.py\n</pre>\n<p>In this example, Docker passes the signal to the shell process instead of to the Python program. This causes the python program to not see the signal sent to the container. If there are multiple processes running inside the container and we need to pass the signal, 1 possible approach is to run the ENTRYPOINT as a script, handle the signal in the script and pass it to the correct process. 1 example using this approach is mentioned <a href=\"https://medium.com/@gchudnov/trapping-signals-in-docker-containers-7a57fdda7d86\">here</a>.</p>\n<h4>Difference between \u201cdocker stop\u201d, \u201cdocker rm\u201d and \u201cdocker kill\u201d</h4>\n<p>\u201cdocker stop\u201d \u2013 Sends SIGTERM to container, waits some time for process to handle it and then sends SIGKILL. Container filesystem remains intact.<br/>\n\u201cdocker kill\u201d \u2013 Sends SIGKILL directly. Container filesystem remains intact.<br/>\n\u201cdocker rm\u201d \u2013 Removes container filesystem. \u201cdocker rm -f\u201d will send SIGKILL and then remove container filesystem.<br/>\nUsing \u201cdocker run\u201d with \u201c\u2013rm\u201d option will automatically remove containers including container filesystem when the container exits.</p>\n<p>When container exits without the container filesystem getting removed, we can still restart the container.</p>\n<h3 id=\"containerrestart\">Container restart policy</h3>\n<p>Container restart policy controls the restart actions when Container exits. Following are the supported restart options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>no \u2013 This is default. Containers do not get restarted when they exit.</li>\n<li>on-failure \u2013 Containers restart only when there is a failure exit code. Any exit code other than 0 is treated as failure.</li>\n<li>unless-stopped \u2013 Containers restart as long as it was not manually stopped by user.</li>\n<li>always \u2013 Always restart container irrespective of exit status.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Following is an example of starting \u201csignaltest\u201d container with restart policy of \u201con-failure\u201d and retry count of 3. Retry count 3 is the number of restarts that will be done by Docker before giving up.</p>\n<pre>docker run -d --name=signaltest --restart=on-failure:3 smakam/signaltest:v1\n</pre>\n<p>To show the restart happening, we can manually try to send signals to the container. In the \u201csignaltest\u201d example, signals SIGTERM, SIGINT and SIGKILL will cause non-zero exit code and SIGUSR1 will cause zero exit code. 1 thing to remember is that restart does not work if we stop the container or send signals using \u201cdocker kill\u201d. I think this is because there must be an explicit check added by Docker to prevent restart in these cases since the action is triggered by user.<br/>\nLets send SIGINT to the container by passing the signal to the process. We can find the process id by doing \u201cps -eaf | grep signalexample\u201d in host machine.</p>\n<pre>kill -s SIGINT  \n</pre>\n<p>Lets check the \u201cdocker ps\u201d output. We can see that the \u201ccreated\u201d time is 50 seconds. Uptime is less than a second because container restarted.</p>\n<pre>$ docker ps\nCONTAINER ID        IMAGE                  COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS                  PORTS               NAMES\nb867543b110c        smakam/signaltest:v1   \"python signalexam...\"   <strong>50 seconds</strong> ago      <strong>Up Less than a second</strong> \n</pre>\n<p>Following command shows the restart policy and the restart count for the running container. In this example, container restart happened once.</p>\n<pre>$ docker inspect signaltest | grep -i -A 2 -B 2 restart\n        \"Name\": \"/signaltest\",\n        \"RestartCount\": 1,\n            \"RestartPolicy\": {\n                \"Name\": \"on-failure\",\n                \"MaximumRetryCount\": 3\n</pre>\n<p>To illustrate that restart does not work on exit code 0, lets send SIGUSR1 to the container that will cause exit code 0.</p>\n<pre>sudo kill -s SIGUSR1  \n</pre>\n<p>In this case, container exits, but it does not get restarted.</p>\n<p>Container restart does not work with \u201c\u2013rm\u201d option. This is because \u201c\u2013rm\u201d option causes container to be removed as soon as the container exit happens.</p>\n<h3 id=\"containerhealth\">Container health check</h3>\n<p>It is possible that container does not exit but it not performing as per the requirement. Health check probes can be used to identify misbehaving containers and take action rather than waiting till the end when container dies. Health check probes are used to accomplish the specific task of checking container health. For a container like webserver, health check probe can be as simple as sending curl request to webserver port. By using container\u2019s health, we can restart the container if health check fails.<br/>\nTo illustrate health check feature, I have used the container described <a href=\"https://hub.docker.com/r/effectivetrainings/docker-health/\">here</a>.<br/>\nFollowing command starts the webserver container with health check capability enabled.</p>\n<pre>docker run -p 8080:8080 -d --rm --name health-check --health-interval=1s --health-timeout=3s --health-retries=3 --health-cmd \"curl -f http://localhost:8080/health || exit 1\" effectivetrainings/docker-health \n</pre>\n<p>Following are all parameters related to healthcheck:</p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"8920\" data-permalink=\"https://sreeninet.wordpress.com/2017/08/15/docker-features-for-handling-containers-death-and-resurrection/container_healthcheck/\" data-orig-file=\"https://sreeninet.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/container_healthcheck.png?w=604\" data-orig-size=\"1497,256\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"container_healthcheck\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://sreeninet.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/container_healthcheck.png?w=604?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://sreeninet.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/container_healthcheck.png?w=604?w=604\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8920\" src=\"https://sreeninet.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/container_healthcheck.png?w=604\" alt=\"container_healthcheck\" srcset=\"https://sreeninet.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/container_healthcheck.png?w=604 604w, https://sreeninet.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/container_healthcheck.png?w=1205 1205w, https://sreeninet.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/container_healthcheck.png?w=150 150w, https://sreeninet.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/container_healthcheck.png?w=300 300w, https://sreeninet.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/container_healthcheck.png?w=768 768w, https://sreeninet.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/container_healthcheck.png?w=1024 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 604px) 100vw, 604px\"/></p>\n<p>Following \u201cdocker ps\u201d output shows container health status:</p>\n<pre>$ docker ps\nCONTAINER ID        IMAGE                              COMMAND                CREATED             STATUS                    PORTS                    NAMES\n947dad1c1412        effectivetrainings/docker-health   \"java -jar /app.jar\"   28 seconds ago      Up 26 seconds <strong>(healthy)</strong>   0.0.0.0:8080-&gt;8080/tcp   health-check\n</pre>\n<p>This container has a backdoor approach to mark container health as unhealthy.

\u201ceffectivetrainings/docker-health\u201d container. Even though we could detect the container as unhealthy, we could not restart the container automatically. For standalone containers, Docker does not have native integration to restart the container on health check failure though we can achieve the same using Docker events and a script. Health check is better integrated with Swarm. With health check integrated to Swarm, when a container in a service is unhealthy, Swarm automatically shuts down the unhealthy container and starts a new container to maintain the container count as specified in the replica count of a service.</p>\n<p>\u201cdocker service\u201d command provides following options for health check and associated behavior.</p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"8922\"

For example, we can control parameters like number of tasks to upgrade at a single time, actions on upgrade failure, delay between task upgrades etc. This helps us achieve release patterns like Blue green and Canary deployment patterns.</p>\n<p>Following options are provided by Docker in \u201cdocker service\u201d command to control rolling upgrade and rollback.</p>\n<p><strong>Rolling upgrade:</strong></p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"8923\" data-permalink=\"https://sreeninet.wordpress.com/2017/08/15/docker-features-for-handling-containers-death-and-resurrection/service_upgrade/\" data-orig-file=\"https://sreeninet.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/service_upgrade.png?w=474&amp;h=180\" data-orig-size=\"1502,570\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"service_upgrade\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://sreeninet.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/service_upgrade.png?w=474&amp;h=180?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://sreeninet.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/service_upgrade.png?w=474&amp;h=180?w=604\" class=\"alignnone  wp-image-8923\" src=\"https://sreeninet.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/service_upgrade.png?w=474&amp;h=180\" alt=\"service_upgrade\" srcset=\"https://sreeninet.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/service_upgrade.png?w=474&amp;h=180 474w, https://sreeninet.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/service_upgrade.png?w=948&amp;h=360 948w, https://sreeninet.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/service_upgrade.png?w=150&amp;h=57 150w, https://sreeninet.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/service_upgrade.png?w=300&amp;h=114 300w, https://sreeninet.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/service_upgrade.png?w=768&amp;h=291 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px\"/></p>\n<p><strong>Rollback:</strong></p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"8919\" data-permalink=\"https://sreeninet.wordpress.com/2017/08/15/docker-features-for-handling-containers-death-and-resurrection/service_rollback/\" data-orig-file=\"https://sreeninet.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/service_rollback.png?w=604\" data-orig-size=\"1626,528\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"service_rollback\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://sreeninet.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/service_rollback.png?w=604?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://sreeninet.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/service_rollback.png?w=604?w=604\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8919\" src=\"https://sreeninet.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/service_rollback.png?w=604\" alt=\"service_rollback\" srcset=\"https://sreeninet.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/service_rollback.png?w=604 604w, https://sreeninet.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/service_rollback.png?w=1208 1208w, https://sreeninet.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/service_rollback.png?w=150 150w, https://sreeninet.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/service_rollback.png?w=300 300w, https://sreeninet.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/service_rollback.png?w=768 768w, https://sreeninet.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/service_rollback.png?w=1024 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 604px) 100vw, 604px\"/></p>\n<p>To illustrate service upgrade, I have a simple python webserver program running as container.<br/>\nFollowing is the Python program:</p>\n<pre>#!/usr/bin/python\n\nimport sys\nfrom BaseHTTPServer import BaseHTTPRequestHandler, HTTPServer\nimport urlparse\nimport json\n\nclass GetHandler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):\n\n    def do_GET(self):\n        message = \"You are using version 1\\n\"\n        self.send_response(200)\n        self.end_headers()\n        self.wfile.write(message)\n        return\n\ndef main():\n    server = HTTPServer(('', 8000), GetHandler)\n    print 'Starting server at http://localhost:8000'\n    server.serve_forever()\n\n# This is the standard boilerplate that calls the main() function.\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n</pre>\n<p>This is the Dockerfile to create the Container:</p>\n<pre>FROM python:2.7\nCOPY ./webserver.py ./webserver.py\nENTRYPOINT [\"python\", \"webserver.py\"]\n</pre>\n<p>I have 2 versions of Container, smakam/webserver:v1 and smakam/webserver:v2.

You have to call to the plumber service. They say that there is a guy, who is honest, and capable, and has a Ph. D. in plumbing, but\u2026 He doesn\u2019t speak English well. He came from Tajikistan and only speaks fluent Tajik. But it just so happens that you studied Tajik in college, so you say that they send the guy immediately.</p><p name=\"a132\" id=\"a132\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">When he arrives, you describe the problem (in Tajik), and he gets to work. Soon enough he finds the problem and tries to report it to you, apparently waiting for a reaction. But for some reason he doesn\u2019t use Tajik to report it, he uses English. Which\u2026 He doesn\u2019t really know. If you reply (in Tajik) that you don\u2019t understand, he will not switch to Tajik; he will only repeat the same phrase louder.</p><p name=\"ca1e\" id=\"ca1e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Which doesn\u2019t help to build a dialog at all.</p><p name=\"a918\" id=\"a918\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Nobody knows why he consistently chooses to reply in the language he doesn\u2019t speak well instead of his own. That you do. It is absurdly irritating, but that\u2019s just how the things work. It\u2019s how they always been. What he speaks in is basically a bad English mixed with professional jargonisms and Tajik obscenities. It looks something like this:</p><blockquote name=\"c42d\" id=\"c42d\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p\">In function \u2018int main()\u2019: 19:16: error: cannot bind \u2018std::ostream {aka std::basic_ostream&lt;char&gt;}\u2019 lvalue to \u2018std::basic_ostream&lt;char&gt;&amp;&amp;\u2019 In file included from /usr/include/c++/4.9/iostream:39:0, from 2: /usr/include/c++/4.9/ostream:602:5: note: initializing argument 1 of \u2018std::basic_ostream&lt;_CharT, _Traits&gt;&amp; std::operator&lt;&lt;(std::basic_ostream&lt;_CharT, _Traits&gt;&amp;&amp;, const _Tp&amp;) [with _CharT = char; _Traits = std::char_traits&lt;char&gt;; _Tp = Element]\u2019 operator&lt;&lt;(basic_ostream&lt;_CharT, _Traits&gt;&amp;&amp; __os, const _Tp&amp; __x)</blockquote><figure name=\"9f7d\" id=\"9f7d\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--blockquote\"><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">[CC BY-SA 2.5 (<a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5\" data-href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5</a>)], via Wikimedia Commons</figcaption></figure><p name=\"d8de\" id=\"d8de\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Ok, it isn\u2019t about plumbing anymore. In fact, It never was about plumbing. It\u2019s about how we communicate with the machine. A programming language is something we use to tell it what to do, but the machine tries to speak back in English when something gets wrong. Computers don\u2019t speak English well, although they are good at processing formal languages. And presumably, the one who writes in formal language should be able to read it back with no problem. Wouldn\u2019t it be better, if the compiler or interpreter would respond in the same language it gets its commands in?</p><p name=\"c1b9\" id=\"c1b9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Somehow the idea seems not all that agreeable without a Tajik plumber.</p><p name=\"3ba2\" id=\"3ba2\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">So far the only language I know that reports errors in the same language you write code is Erlang. If you know more, please let me know in the comment section below.</p><p name=\"c7f1\" id=\"c7f1\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Here\u2019s a simple example from \u201c<a href=\"https://pragprog.com/book/jaerlang2/programming-erlang\" data-href=\"https://pragprog.com/book/jaerlang2/programming-erlang\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Programming Erlang</a>\u201d:</p><pre name=\"fc2b\" id=\"fc2b\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\">1&gt; Point = {point, 10, 45}.<br/>2&gt; {point, C, C} = Point.<br/>=ERROR REPORT==== 28-Oct-2006::17:17:00 ===<br/>Error in process &lt;0.32.0&gt; with exit value:<br/><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pre-strong\">{{badmatch,{point,10,45}},[{erl_eval,expr,3}]}</strong></pre><p name=\"9db9\" id=\"9db9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\">The string in bold is the error message, the rest is just a preamble from the interpreter. Indeed, it isn\u2019t entirely convenient for the casual reader. You have to know Erlang to read its errors. But since you still need to know Erlang to write the code that causes them, it\u2019s fine.</p><p name=\"cc55\" id=\"cc55\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The alternatives are much worse. With informal and non-standardized error messaging you would have to know not only the programming language itself but its error messaging Pidgin as well. Every C++ practitioner can confirm that reading STL messages is an art by itself. It takes knowledge, patience, determination and, occasionally, a crystal ball to build a firm understanding of a reported problem.</p><p name=\"47b5\" id=\"47b5\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">For instance, the error message from above reads as \u201csorry, I can\u2019t print out an <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">element</code> for you, because its type doesn\u2019t have a <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">&lt;&lt;</code> operator.\u201d</p><p name=\"c6a2\" id=\"c6a2\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Normally the language is something you can build a dialog in. Programming languages are an unlucky exemption. Historically it was more important to tell a computer what to do rather than the opposite. When you write a small single-threaded program you can hope that there will be no errors whatsoever, so you don\u2019t really need a reporting at all. Error reporting was always viewed as an auxiliary feature.</p><p name=\"8789\" id=\"8789\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Erlang, however, aims at building highly complex distributed systems. Errors are not only most likely to happen, they are inherent to the nature of the domain. Everything that could go wrong eventually will. And you better have a decent reporting language for that.</p><p name=\"4d56\" id=\"4d56\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">The very fact that you can have a dialog, meaning writing code and receiving errors in the same language, makes Erlang not only programming but a true computer language.</p></div></div></body></html>"}, "15430796": {"score": 24, "comments": [], "time": "2017-10-09 03:28:51", "url": "https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/lines-work/mutual-interest", "text": "<html><body><div><div class=\"content-wrapper\">\n            <p>I met Pierre Curie for the first time in the spring of the year 1894. I was then living in Paris where for three years I had been studying at the Sorbonne. I had passed the examinations for the licentiate in physics and was preparing for those in mathematics. At the same time I had begun to work in the research laboratory of Professor Lippmann. A Polish physicist whom I knew, and who was a great admirer of Pierre Curie, one day invited us together to spend the evening with himself and his wife.</p>\n<p>As I entered the room, Pierre Curie was standing in the recess of a French window opening on a balcony. He seemed to me very young, though he was at that time thirty-five years old. I was struck by the open expression of his face and by the slight suggestion of detachment in his whole attitude. His speech, rather slow and deliberate, his simplicity, and his smile, at once grave and youthful, inspired confidence. We began a conversation which soon became friendly. It first concerned certain scientific matters about which I was very glad to be able to ask his opinion. Then we discussed certain social and humanitarian subjects which interested us both. There was, between his conceptions and mine, despite the difference between our native countries, a surprising kinship, no doubt attributable to a certain likeness in the moral atmosphere in which we were both raised by our families.</p>\n<p>We met again at the Physics Society and in the laboratory. Then he asked if he might call upon me. I lived at that time in a room on the sixth floor of a house situated near the schools. It was a poor little room, for my resources were extremely limited. I was nevertheless very happy in it for I was now first realizing, although already twenty-five years old, the ardent desire I had so long cherished of carrying on advanced studies in science.\u00a0</p>\n<p/><div class=\"randomquote\"><div class=\"node-3627\"><article class=\"pull-quote-block block inline back-color-100\"><div class=\"pull-quote-wrapper border-color-35\"><div class=\"module-content\">\n  <p>I like work; it fascinates me. I can sit and look at it for hours.</p>\n<cite class=\"quote-author\">\u2014Jerome K. Jerome, \n  1889</cite></div></div></article></div></div>\n<p>Pierre Curie came to see me and showed a simple and sincere sympathy with my student life. Soon he caught the habit of speaking to me of his dream of an existence consecrated entirely to scientific research, and he asked me to share that life. It was not, however, easy for me to make such a decision, for it meant separation from my country and my family, and the renouncement of certain social projects that were dear to me. Having grown up in an atmosphere of patriotism kept alive by the oppression of Poland, I wished, like many other young people of my country, to contribute my effort toward the conservation of our national spirit.</p>\n<p>So matters stood when at the beginning of my vacation I left Paris to go to my father in Poland. Our correspondence during this separation helped to strengthen the bond of affection between us.</p>\n<p>During the year 1894, Pierre Curie wrote me letters that seem to me admirable in their form. No one of them was very long, for he had the habit of concise expression, but all were written in a spirit of sincerity and with an evident anxiety to make the one he desired as a companion know him as he was. It is appropriate to quote here a few lines which express how he looked on the possibility of our marriage:</p>\n<blockquote><p>It would, nevertheless, be a beautiful thing in which I hardly dare believe, to pass through life together hypnotized in our dreams: your dream for your country, our dream for humanity, our dream for science. Of all these dreams, I believe the last alone is legitimate. I mean to say by this that we are powerless to change the social order. Even if this were not true we should not know what to do. And in working without understanding, we should never be sure that we were not doing more harm than good, by retarding some inevitable evolution. From the point of view of science, on the contrary, we can pretend to accomplish something. The territory here is more solid and obvious, and however small it is, it is truly in our possession. I strongly advise you to return to Paris in October.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>One can understand from this letter that for Pierre Curie there was only one way of looking at the future. He had dedicated his life to his dream of science: he felt the need of a companion who could live his dream with him. He told me many times that the reason he had not married until he was thirty-six was because he did not believe in the possibility of a marriage which would meet this, his absolute necessity.</p>\n<p>After my return from my vacation, our friendship grew more and more precious to us; each realized that he or she could find no better life companion. We decided, therefore, to marry, and the ceremony took place in July 1895.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Professor Curie\u2019s salary was six thousand francs a year, and we held that he should not undertake any supplementary work, at least in the beginning. As for myself, I was preparing to take the examination for the aggregation of young women, in view of obtaining a teaching post. These I passed in 1896. We ordered our life to suit our scientific work and our days were passed in the laboratory, where it was permitted that I might work with my husband.</p>\n<p>He was then engaged in a research on the growth of crystals, which interested him keenly. He wished to know if certain faces of a crystal had a preferential development chiefly because they have a different rapidity of growth or because their solubility is different. He quickly obtained interesting results (not published), but he had to interrupt his investigations to undertake others on radioactivity. And he often regretted that he was never able to return to them. I was occupied at this time with the study of the magnetization of tempered steel.</p>\n<p/><div class=\"standard\"><div id=\"node-3665\" class=\"node-artwork clearfix art\">\n  <img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/sites/default/files/images/artwork/18._89193.jpg\" alt=\"The White Feather Fan, by John William Waterhouse, 1879.

The chair was a new one and carried no prescribed course of study. He divided his lectures at first between crystallography and electricity. Then, as he recognized more and more the utility of a serious theoretical course in electricity for future engineers, he devoted himself entirely to this subject and succeeded in establishing a course (of about 120 lectures) that was the most complete and modern then to be had in Paris. This cost him a considerable effort, of which I was the daily witness, for he was always anxious to give a complete picture of the phenomena and of the evolution of theories, and of ideas. He was always anxious, too, that his mode of exposition should be clear and precise. He thought of publishing a treatise summing up this course, but unfortunately the many preoccupations of the following years prevented him from putting this plan into execution.</p>\n<p>We lived a very single life, interested in common, as we were, in our laboratory experiments and in the preparation of lectures and examinations. During eleven years we were scarcely ever separated, which means that there are very few lines of existing correspondence between us, representing that period. We spent our rest days and our vacations walking or bicycling either in the country near Paris, along the sea, or in the mountains. My husband was so engrossed in his researches, however, that it was very difficult for him to remain for any length of time in a place where he lacked facilities for work. After a few days, he would say, \u201cIt seems to me a very long time since we have accomplished anything.\u201d</p>\n            \n                <article id=\"contrib-bio-block\" class=\"wrapper\">\n                  <div class=\"bio-block back-color-15\">\n                                        \n                                        <p/><p>From <em>Pierre Curie and Autobiographical Notes</em>. In 1903 Marie, Pierre, and Henri Becquerel received the Nobel Prize in Physics for their discovery of radioactivity, and in 1911 she received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for isolating pure radium; she was the first woman to win a Nobel and the only one to have done so in two fields. During World War I, she and one of her daughters worked to develop X-radiography. She died at the age of sixty-six in 1934.</p>&#13;\n\n                  </div>\n                </article>\n          <article class=\"sticky-issue\">\n\t<p class=\"sticky-header-bar back-color-100\">\n\t  <h1>Issue</h1>\n\t</p>\n\t<p class=\"sticky-vertical-bar back-color-100\">\n\t  <h1>Back to Issue</h1>\n\t</p>\n\t\n\t\n</article>\n\n        </div>\n                              </div></body></html>"}, "15429774": {"score": 1, "comments": [], "time": "2017-10-08 23:13:37", "url": "https://www.eventbrite.com/e/live-seattle-seahawks-vs-los-angeles-rams-live-stream-8th-oct-2017-tickets-38706122053", "text": "<html><body><div><div class=\"js-xd-read-more-contents l-mar-top-3\" data-automation=\"listing-event-description\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Seattle Seahawks Vs Los Angeles Rams Live Stream</p>\n<h2>.....................................................................</h2>\n\n\n<h2><span>.....................................................................</span></h2>\n<p><span/></p>\n<p><br/> Depending on your market you can also find a free Seattle Seahawks vs Los Angeles Rams live stream if you are a Seattle Seahawks Vs Los Angeles Rams Live Stream How To Watch <br/> Depending on your market you can also find a free Seattle Seahawks vs Los Angeles Rams live stream if you are a Seattle Seahawks vs Los Angeles Rams Live Eventbrite<br/> 19 mins ago Eventbrite FREE|| Seattle Seahawks vs Los Angeles Rams Live Stream Monday October 2 2017 at New York New York NY2 hours ago [WatchFREE]Seahawks vs Rams Live Stream FREE IBM orks com muni tyb logs sou dbty baop w32m a 5 hours ago Arizona <br/> NFL Week 4 Los Angeles Rams vs Seattle Seahawks Game time</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div></body></html>"}, "15430291": {"score": 2, "comments": [], "time": "2017-10-09 01:12:51", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7xndvitLa8", "text": "<html><body><div><div id=\"action-panel-rental-required\" class=\"action-panel-content hid\">\n      <p id=\"watch-actions-rental-required\">\n    <strong>\u041e\u0446\u0435\u043d\u043a\u0430 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435 \u0430\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0434\u044b \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043e-</strong>\n  </p>\n\n  </div>\n\n  <div id=\"action-panel-error\" class=\"action-panel-content hid\">\n    <p class=\"action-panel-error\">\n      \u0412 \u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043c\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442 \u044d\u0442\u0430 \u0444\u0443\u043d\u043a\u0446\u0438\u044f \u043d\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f\u043d\u0430. \u041f\u043e\u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043f\u044b\u0442\u043a\u0443 \u043f\u043e\u0437\u0436\u0435.\n    </p>\n  </div>\n\n    </div></body></html>"}, "15429270": {"score": 3, "comments": [], "time": "2017-10-08 21:19:39", "url": "https://www.insidescience.org/news/why-do-so-many-americans-win-nobel-prize", "text": "<html><body><div><p class=\"field-subtitle\">\n    According to experts, it's strong historic investment in basic science, academic freedom for researchers and patience to see results.   </p>\n\n  <div class=\"field-body\">\n    <p>(Inside Science) -- Amidst talk of scientific revolutions at a press conference in Stockholm for the <a href=\"https://www.insidescience.org/news/update-three-share-chemistry-nobel-prize-developing-new-technique-image-molecules-life\">Nobel Prize in chemistry on Wednesday</a>, a woman identifying herself as a freelance radio reporter from China raised her hand in the camera-packed, wood-paneled room and asked why so many Americans win the Nobel Prize.</p>\n<p>Seven of the nine science Nobel winners this week are affiliated with American institutions, though not all were born here. Going back more than 100 years, some 264 winners were born in the United States, and many others immigrated to the U.S. to conduct research at American institutions. The next highest country is the U.K., as the birthplace of 84 winners, though it beats the U.S. in winners per capita.</p>\n<p>In response to the reporter's question on Wednesday, Goran Hansson, the secretary general of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, said the primary reasons are funding and academic freedom. Since the mid-20th century, the United States has spent a tremendous amount on fundamental or \"basic\" research, not forcing scientists to work on projects with an immediate application as the goal.</p>\n<p>Experts in science funding agreed that the overabundance of American Nobel Prize winners is no coincidence. Basic science is where the biggest long-term breakthroughs come from, and Nobel Prizes tend to recognize those breakthroughs. So, if you want to know the secret of today's Nobel Prizes, you have to look to the past.</p>\n<p>\"These prizes are a lagging indicator,\" said Marc Kastner, a physicist in California who heads an organization called the Science Philanthropy Alliance, which works with donors on ways to direct their giving toward basic science research. \"They show us what we were doing right decades ago.\"</p>\n<h3><strong>The strength of American post-war science</strong></h3>\n<p>Although this year\u2019s chemistry Nobel Prize recognized only one American researcher -- German-born Joachim Frank -- in its trio of winners, the development of cryo-electron microscopy -- the technique behind the prize -- still illustrates the payoffs that can come from basic science research in the United States.</p>\n<p>\"This prize is based mainly on steady advances in cryo-EM made in the 'golden era' of funding for basic science in the USA, following Sputnik,\" said John Spence of Arizona State University.</p>\n<p>Though much of the work took place in Europe, the portion of work taking place in the United States benefitted from a permissive climate for basic science research. Kastner traces that climate back to the end of World War II and to the vision of engineer and science administrator Vannevar Bush, who led the Office of Scientific Research and Development, which oversaw the Manhattan project.</p>\n<p>At the end of the war, Bush prepared a report to the president that placed a strong emphasis on basic research and eventually led to the creation of the National Science Foundation in 1950. He adopted the position that it was the government's responsibility to do basic research through the universities. That model became enshrined in the U.S. approach to financing science after the war, one fruit of which is the overabundance of Nobel Prizes for researchers at American universities.</p>\n<p>\"The resources for smart people to try creative things have been there because the federal government has been willing to take the gamble,\" Kastner said.</p>\n<p>Kastner's organization seeks to offer advice to philanthropists and to increase philanthropic support for basic research. \"It will never take the place of federal funding, but it can do things the federal government has trouble doing,\" he said.</p>\n<p>National Institute of General Medical Sciences director Jon Lorsch leads an agency that funds about 11 percent of all NIH grants, including the work of many <a href=\"https://www.nigms.nih.gov/education/pages/factsheet_NIGMSNobelists.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">past and present</a> Nobel laureates. He said historically about half of the research funds at NIGMS and other NIH agencies have gone toward basic research, much of it funded through investigator-initiated grants where the agencies fund the ideas the scientists themselves come up with.</p>\n<p>Last year, he was one of several agency heads who co-authored a letter with NIH Director Francis Collins in <em>Science</em> Magazine affirming the NIH's support for basic science. It specifically mentioned cryo-electron microscopy as a transformative area that has yielded \"spectacular\" returns on taxpayer investment.</p>\n<p>Lorsch also pointed to his agency's creation of a new funding mechanism for basic research into technology that seeks to give grants to physicists, engineers and other people who are not themselves biologists but who might develop basic technology biologists may use.</p>\n<p>\"We wanted to find a way to support those crazy ideas that are going to transform biology in the coming decade,\" Lorsch said.</p>\n<p>But if crazy ideas take decades to come to fruition, to what extent does the public understand and appreciate the connection between basic research funding and scientific advances?</p>\n<h3><strong>The case of missing returns</strong></h3>\n<p>You can blame Archimedes, in part, for any expectation of immediate returns. That ancient, apocryphal story of him pondering how to weigh the gold in the king's crown, crawling into the brimming bath, tipping the water from the tub, and then running naked through the streets of Syracuse shouting, \"Eureka!\" belies the long, deliberative process that modern science has become.</p>\n<p>\"It can be decades before a basic science finding leads to a breakthrough in terms of applications,\" Lorsch said.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Because the practical applications of all basic discoveries are not always immediately obvious, he added, funding agencies often evaluate basic research by looking at things like the number and quality of publications stemming from the research, derivative technologies, patents or collaborations that emerge.</p>\n<p>But does the general public get that?</p>\n<p>\"We have been incredibly ineffective at communicating the products of basic research,\" said David Helfand, an astronomer at Columbia University who serves on the board of the nonprofit organization Science Counts, which seeks to promote public awareness and support of science.</p>\n<p><em>(Editor's note: Helfand also sits on the board of directors of the American Institute of Physics, which publishes Inside Science.)</em></p>\n<p>If you ask the public their views on science, most will consistently say they love it, Helfand said. But when you ask people what they would cut if they could cut any discretionary spending, he added, \"scientific research comes out number one every time.\"</p>\n<p>This hints at a disconnect between appreciating the tangible results of science and the slow, accumulation of knowledge that drives those advances. People love discovery but not paying for discovery, Helfand said.</p>\n<p>Helfand and his colleagues just launched a test campaign this week that seeks to engage the public beginning next spring in several midsized cities like Dallas, Texas that will seek to gain insight into public attitudes toward science in order to inform public outreach.</p>\n<p>\"We are going to engage people in a serious way and see if they will take action,\" Helfand said.</p>\n<p>Other efforts are also underway to connect the dots.</p>\n<p>This summer a group from Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois published a study that surveyed 5 million U.S. patents and 32 million research articles from around the world and attempted to map the connection between the two. It found that most new patents can be tied back to research articles.</p>\n<p>Another group at the University of California, San Francisco and the Gladstone Institute examined two different recently FDA-approved drugs and used the tools of network analysis to attempt an unbiased approach to linking the success of those drugs to the constellation of research articles that led to their approval.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"What we found when we analyzed that was rather surprising,\" said R.\u00a0Sanders Williams from the Gladstone Institutes and the University of California, San Francisco.</p>\n<p>Their work showed that the basic and clinical research behind the new drugs involved thousands of different researchers at thousands of different institutions who published some 1,500 papers, some going back many years.</p>\n<p>\"Much of that work was purely basic science,\" Lorsch said.</p>\n<p>What the work showed, said Williams, was evidence for the need to fund a broad base of basic science. \"Everyone wants to fund that last step, and few recognize you have to fund that broad base,\" he said.</p>\n<p>\"If you want a cure for currently unsolved diseases, it's going to take decades, it's going to be unpredictable and it's going to take a large base.\"</p>\n  </div>\n  </div></body></html>"}, "15431317": {"score": 5, "comments": ["Was really looking for loading time stats and similar instead of just CPU and GPU benchmarks.

Since 2016, we have collected more than a hundred thousand benchmark results for seven different iPhone models across three different versions of iOS.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>These benchmark results provide a unique insight into the everyday performance of each iPhone model over time. And, as you'll see, there are no signs of a conspiracy.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<h2>How we test iPhone performance</h2>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>3DMark is a free benchmarking app for testing the performance of smartphones. It works by running a demanding series of tests. Each test produces a set of scores that you can use to compare devices. The recommended test for recent iPhone models is called <i>Sling Shot Extreme</i>.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<h2>Are older iPhones being deliberately slowed?</h2>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>We looked at data for the iPhone 5s first because, if older devices are being deliberately slowed, the effect should be most obvious with models that have been around for longer.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>The chart below shows iPhone 5s GPU performance over time. Each bar shows the average 3DMark Sling Shot Extreme Graphics test score calculated from all results submitted during that month. A higher score indicated better performance. The bars are coloured according to iOS version.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>As you can see, iPhone 5s GPU performance has remained consistent from iOS 9 to iOS 11 with only minor variations that fall well within normal levels.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><a href=\"https://www.futuremark.com/hwc/tmp/iphone5s-sling-shot-extreme-gpu-performance.jpg\"><img src=\"https://www.futuremark.com/hwc/tmp/iphone5s-sling-shot-extreme-gpu-performance.jpg\" alt=\"iPhone 5s Sling Shot Extreme GPU performance\" class=\"imagestretch\"/></a></p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>The next chart below shows CPU performance over time as measured by the 3DMark Sling Shot Extreme Physics test.

GPU performance has remained consistent across iOS versions with only minor variations.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>The graphs for CPU performance show a very slight drop in performance over time - possibly due to minor iOS updates or other factors - but a user would be unlikely to notice this small difference in everyday use.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><a href=\"https://www.futuremark.com/hwc/tmp/iphone-gpu-and-cpu-performance-in-sling-shot-extreme.jpg\"><img src=\"https://www.futuremark.com/hwc/tmp/iphone-gpu-and-cpu-performance-in-sling-shot-extreme.jpg\" alt=\"iPhone GPU and CPU performance in Sling Shot Extreme\" class=\"imagestretch\"/></a></p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<h2>Why do searches for \"iPhone slow\" spike when new models are released?</h2>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Our benchmarking data shows that, rather than intentionally degrading the performance of older models, Apple actually does a good job of supporting its older devices with regular updates that maintain a consistent level of performance across iOS versions.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>That said, there are some factors that might affect people's perception of performance after updating an older device with a newer version of iOS. An update might add new features that use more resources or require more processing power. New apps developed for the latest models might not run as smoothly on older devices. Conversely, apps designed for an earlier version of iOS might not take full advantage of optimizations in the latest version. And then there is always the\u00a0 psychological effect of knowing that there is a new and improved model available, which can make your own device seem outdated.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<h2>How to test your own Android or Apple phone\u00a0</h2>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>3DMark is a free benchmarking app available from the <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/app/3dmark-sling-shot-benchmark/id1015301759?ls=1&amp;mt=8&quot;\">Apple App Store</a> and <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.futuremark.dmandroid.application\">Google Play</a>.

The managers may have been motivated to engage in this behavior because leadership instituted performance targets that were unrealizable, she added.</p>\n<p>When creating a new unit, a company's top management usually also sketches out the unit's performance routines \u2014 for example, they set goals, develop incentives and designate certain responsibilities, according to the researchers. Middle managers are then tasked with carrying out these new directives. But, in the company studied by the researchers, this turned out to be impossible.</p>\n<p>\"What we found in this particular case \u2014 but I think it happens a lot \u2014 is that there were obstacles in the way of achieving these goals set by top management,\" said Trevi\u00f1o. \"For a variety of reasons, the goals were unrealistic and unachievable. The workers didn't have enough training. They didn't feel competent. They didn't know the products well enough. There weren't enough customers and there wasn't even enough time to get all the work done.\"</p>\n<p>Facing these obstacles, middle management enacted a series of moves designed to deceive top management into believing that teams were actually meeting their goals, according to Trevi\u00f1o, who worked with Niki A. den Nieuwenboer, assistant professor of organizational behavior and business ethics, University of Kansas; and Joa\u1dc3o Viera da Cunha, associate professor, IESEG School of Management.</p>\n<p>\"It became clear to middle managers that there was no way their people could meet these goals,\" said Trevi\u00f1o. \"They got really creative because their bonuses are tied to what their people do, or because they didn't want to lose their jobs. Middle managers exploited vulnerabilities they identified in the organization to come up with ways to make it look like their workers were achieving goals when they weren't.\"</p>\n<p>According to the researchers, these strategies included coopting sales from another unit, portraying orders as actual sales and ensuring that the flow of sales data reported in the company's IT system looked normal. Middle managers created some of these behaviors on their own, but they also learned tactics from other managers, according to the researchers, who report their findings in Organization Science, online now.</p>\n<p>Middle managers also used a range of tactics to coerce their subordinates to keep up the ruse, including rewards for unethical behavior and public shaming for those who were reluctant to engage in the unethical tactics.</p>\n<p>\"Interestingly, what we didn't see is managers speaking up, we didn't see them pushing back against the unrealistic goals,\" said Trevi\u00f1o. \"We know a lot about what we refer to as 'voice' in an organization and people are fearful and they tend to keep quiet for the most part.\"</p>\n<p>The researchers suggested that the findings could offer insights into other scandals, such as the Wells Fargo and the U.S. Veteran Administration hospital misconduct. They added that top management in organizations should do more in-depth work to institute realistic goals and incentives.</p>\n<p>\"Everybody has goals and goals are motivating, but there are nuances,\" said Trevi\u00f1o. \"What goal-setting theory says is that if you're not committed to the goal because you think it's unachievable, you'll just throw your hands up and give up. Most front-line employees wanted to do that. But the managers intervened, coercing them to engage in the unethical behaviors.\"</p>\n<p>This type of deception can harm an organization in several ways, including its bottom line through the awarding of bonuses based on this deceptive performance, but also because upper management made strategic decisions and allocated resources based on the unit's feigned success.</p>\n<p>\"How can you lead a company if the performance information you get is fake? You end up making bad decisions,\" den Nieuwenboer said.</p>\n<p>One of the researchers gathered data for over a year as part of an ethnographic study, a type of study that requires researchers to immerse themselves in the culture and the lives of their subjects. In this case, the ethnographer studied the implementation of a new unit in the telecom company. As part of the data collection, the researcher spent 273 days shadowing workers, 20 days observing middle managers, listened to approximately 15 to 22 informal \u2014 lunch or watercooler \u2014 breaks between workers per week and conducted 105 formal interviews. Interactions on the phone, through email and in face-to-face meetings were observed and documented.</p>\n<p>\"One of the advantages that this kind of data affords you is the opportunity to observe what's going on across hierarchical levels,\" said Trevi\u00f1o. \"The middle management role is largely an invisible role. As a researcher, you just don't get to see that role very often.\"</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"}, "15429784": {"score": 80, "comments": ["Man-oh-man did that take a while to load...<p>You can always tell you&#x27;ve landed on a wix site when you&#x27;re faced with blank screen for a while.<p>Edit: 10MB... this page is 10MB. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;uAoc05H.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;uAoc05H.png</a>", "Scroll down to the bottom... it goes up to 40MB.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;eylvt\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;eylvt</a>", "On the one hand, at least they&#x27;re doing progressive loading.<p>On the other hand <i>oh my god it&#x27;s 40MB, this is pants-on-head crazy</i>.<p>That&#x27;s 20X the average web-page size, which is already bloated. <i>20X</i> .

These days you have to include Facebook pages in there as well. You can set up a basic online presence for next to no money with these, and in most cases you can buy a reasonably professional-looking theme to make your site look decent for not much more.

Someone like me, or no doubt many others on HN, can build you a site that does more or less anything and adopts whatever distinctive branding you need. However, we&#x27;re going to charge about as much for an hour or two of our time as the whole thing costs with one of the site builder tools, and your final bill is going to have at least two more zeroes on it to do roughly the same job and probably more if we&#x27;re doing anything that makes it worth using us in the first place.<p>There isn&#x27;t much room in between any longer.

I had to write down my thoughts and share them with you.</p><p name=\"c072\" id=\"c072\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The music as we know it may soon going to stop in the crypto world. Well at least pause for a while.</p><p name=\"8e1f\" id=\"8e1f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Spending time and energy in the space i am sensing a high amount of signals pointing to that direction. The most important one is that a few important countries do want to regulate the Crypto World but won\u2019t manage to do it quickly. It\u2019s complicated and will take them time to figure it out. And most regulation authorities may not have the time to wait for a solution in the view of so many ICOs getting scammy and <a href=\"https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/cobinhood-ceo-apologizes-for-icos-questionable-presale/\" data-href=\"https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/cobinhood-ceo-apologizes-for-icos-questionable-presale/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">out of control.</a></p><h3 name=\"49a1\" id=\"49a1\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">The possible dark\u00a0scenario</h3><p name=\"bf12\" id=\"bf12\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">So here is what i think <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">may</em></strong> happen in the short future: Because they can\u2019t ban cryptos (and don\u2019t have an interest in doing so) like China did (and i am not even sure it will last long as elections are coming up\u2026), i believe the SEC, AMF and a few other national security organizations will target a few high profile ICOs (not just <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2017/10/01/sec-ico-fraud-charges/\" data-href=\"http://fortune.com/2017/10/01/sec-ico-fraud-charges/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">scammers</a> this time) via exchanges and those same exchanges will have to delist them because they qualify as security. I don\u2019t think those authorities have any other way short term to address the current mess but to start with examples. Those moves will create a wave of panic in the crypto world which would create a flash crash in most valuations. The SEC won\u2019t have to go after all the tokens (and they <a href=\"https://www.ethnews.com/european-parliament-customs-officials-lack-sufficient-resources-to-monitor-cryptocurrency\" data-href=\"https://www.ethnews.com/european-parliament-customs-officials-lack-sufficient-resources-to-monitor-cryptocurrency\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">physically can\u2019t</a>\u200a\u2014\u200abecause it s a global play) they believe should be removed, they will just need to asphyxiate the market out panic. Millions will be stuck with tokens worth very little and don\u2019t believe decentralized exchanges will come to the rescue: it will be a psychological freeze. Of course new comers to ICO will dry up or stop immediately and the music will stop for a while.</p><p name=\"6e6e\" id=\"6e6e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Facebook, Apple and all fast growing marketplaces have acted in a similar way when they want to stop a wave of apps acting in a negative way in their market. I don\u2019t think the authorities have any other realistic option given the speed and excess of the market.</p><h3 name=\"e65a\" id=\"e65a\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">But is it really a bad\u00a0thing?</h3><p name=\"37b1\" id=\"37b1\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">I don\u2019t think so. I think the music as we know it has to stop. Allowing companies to get their unbaked ICO tokens immediately traded when no product is even available (and won\u2019t be for a long time) makes only the game of pure unhealthy speculation. Allowing people to buy tokens they don t understand, will never use because <a href=\"https://medium.com/@pentremont/icos-youre-scammy-and-you-know-it-62c104dbfabb\" data-href=\"https://medium.com/@pentremont/icos-youre-scammy-and-you-know-it-62c104dbfabb\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" target=\"_blank\">they are not the natural users</a> of those tokens (Kik i am looking at you), and will never be, can only attract day traders and short term flippers. This is not the \u201cnetwork effect\u201d that is claimed in most white papers.</p><p name=\"24bf\" id=\"24bf\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I think too many ICOs don\u2019t have what it takes to deliver on their promises today: vague teams, unclear road maps, uncommitted or incomplete teams,\u2026 But here is the thing, the market need to test the good projects. There are too many ICOs funds, Crypto Funds, more than there are projects to fund. There will be soon more exchanges that tokens that you can trade. Just insane.</p></div><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><p name=\"d3df\" id=\"d3df\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Those who raised will be tested during this dry period. Many will survive enough time because they raised a lot of money but they will have to create value quickly so the market believes their token is still worth something and recover from an inevitable market crash.</p><p name=\"103d\" id=\"103d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The big wash will keep the best players in the game and i am sure that out of 1000 ICOs a good solid 10% will make it over a long period. By the time those winners find their way up, build real value, networks effect and establish an intrinsic value to their token, the regulations will be in place and healthy ICOs will take place again. Maybe the survivors will organize even a second wave of ICO to boost things up.</p><p name=\"8c26\" id=\"8c26\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">During that time investments will keep up but in fat protocols and i would not be surprised to see, in a context where many traditional economies may go west and classical store of value models become untrusted, the value of Bitcoin explode because it is uncorrelated to ICOs. I think Ethereum has a good chance to grow once those bad ICOs stop and that the world can focus on getting Ethereum migrated to a scalable protocol that will really be able to support ICO funded Dapps and companies that promise the Moon, but just can\u2019t deliver it today.</p><p name=\"4f4c\" id=\"4f4c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I would not bet that the music keep going for tokens for a long time, at least for a majority of them. <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/icos-dont-bite-off-more-than-you-can-chew-d658aae9579e?source=linkShare-454d729d5955-1507351244\" data-href=\"https://hackernoon.com/icos-dont-bite-off-more-than-you-can-chew-d658aae9579e?source=linkShare-454d729d5955-1507351244\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" target=\"_blank\">Clean up time is due</a>.

Be\u00a0long.</h3><p name=\"6815\" id=\"6815\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Does that mean you should stop investing in crypto? Absolutely not. But if you do make sure you are super long. Invest only in things you seriously believe you can HODL for over 2 years. Personally i am going to reduce considerably my positions on tokens and ICOs. I am super long on a few of them but going to recenter my positions on main coins (at least those i really believe in) until i see more clearly. There is no doubt in my mind we\u2019re building a multi trillion dollar economy over the years but this requires a small reset until we reach that.</p><p name=\"2524\" id=\"2524\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">Am i the only one to see that coming?</p></div></div></div></body></html>"}, "15429790": {"score": 1, "comments": [], "time": "2017-10-08 23:16:47", "url": "https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2014/03/choosing_secure_1.html", "text": "<html><body><div><div class=\"article\">\n\t\n\t\n\n\t<h2 class=\"entry\" id=\"a005263\">Choosing Secure Passwords</h2>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n    \n\t    <p>As insecure as passwords generally are, they're not going away anytime soon. Every year you have more and more passwords to deal with, and every year they get easier and easier to break. You need a strategy.</p>\n\n<p>The best way to explain how to choose a good password is to explain how they're broken. The general attack model is what's known as an offline password-guessing attack. In this scenario, the attacker gets a file of encrypted passwords from somewhere people want to authenticate to. His goal is to turn that encrypted file into unencrypted passwords he can use to authenticate himself. He does this by guessing passwords, and then seeing if they're correct. He can try guesses as fast as his computer will process them -- and he can parallelize the attack -- and gets immediate confirmation if he guesses correctly. Yes, there are ways to foil this attack, and that's why we can still have four-digit PINs on ATM cards, but it's the correct model for breaking passwords.</p>\n\n<p>There are commercial programs that do password cracking, sold primarily to police departments. There are also <a href=\"http://www.openwall.com/john/\">hacker</a> <a href=\"http://hashcat.net/\">tools</a> that do the same thing. And they're <i>really</i> good.</p>\n\n<p>The efficiency of password cracking <a href=\"http://www.lightbluetouchpaper.org/2012/09/03/password-cracking-part-i-how-much-has-cracking-improved/\">depends</a> <a href=\"http://www.lightbluetouchpaper.org/2012/09/04/password-cracking-part-ii-when-does-password-cracking-matter/\">on</a> two largely independent things: power and efficiency.</p>\n\n<p>Power is simply computing power. As computers have become faster, they're able to test more passwords per second; one program advertises <a href=\"http://hackersnewsbulletin.com/2013/09/new-password-cracking-software-tries-8-million-times-per-second-crack-password.html\">eight million</a> per second. These crackers might run for days, on many machines simultaneously.  For a high-profile police case, they might run for months.</p>\n\n<p>Efficiency is the ability to guess passwords cleverly. It doesn't make sense to run through every eight-letter combination from \"aaaaaaaa\" to \"zzzzzzzz\" in order. That's 200 billion possible passwords, most of them very unlikely. Password crackers try the most <a href=\"https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/12/realworld_passw.html\">common</a> <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-25-most-common-passwords-of-2013/\">passwords</a> first.</p>\n\n<p>A typical password consists of a root plus an appendage. The root isn't necessarily a dictionary word, but it's usually something pronounceable. An appendage is either a suffix (90% of the time) or a prefix (10% of the time). One cracking program I saw started with a dictionary of about 1,000 common passwords, things like \"letmein,\" \"temp,\" \"123456,\" and so on. Then it tested them each with about 100 common suffix appendages: \"1,\" \"4u,\" \"69,\" \"abc,\" \"!,\" and so on. It recovered about a quarter of all passwords with just these 100,000 combinations.</p>\n\n<p>Crackers use different dictionaries: English words, names, foreign words, phonetic patterns and so on for roots; two digits, dates, single symbols and so on for appendages. They run the dictionaries with various capitalizations and common substitutions: \"$\" for \"s\", \"@\" for \"a,\" \"1\" for \"l\" and so on. This guessing strategy quickly breaks about two-thirds of all passwords.</p>\n\n<p>Modern password crackers <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/05/how-crackers-make-minced-meat-out-of-your-passwords/\">combine different words</a> from their dictionaries:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>What was remarkable about all three cracking sessions were the types of plains that got revealed. They included passcodes such as \"k1araj0hns0n,\" \"Sh1a-labe0uf,\" \"Apr!l221973,\" \"Qbesancon321,\" \"DG091101%,\" \"@Yourmom69,\" \"ilovetofunot,\" \"windermere2313,\" \"tmdmmj17,\" and \"BandGeek2014.\" Also included in the list: \"all of the lights\" (yes, spaces are allowed on many sites), \"i hate hackers,\" \"allineedislove,\" \"ilovemySister31,\" \"iloveyousomuch,\" \"Philippians4:13,\" \"Philippians4:6-7,\" and \"qeadzcwrsfxv1331.\" \"gonefishing1125\" was another password Steube saw appear on his computer screen. Seconds after it was cracked, he noted, \"You won't ever find it using brute force.\"</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>This is why the oft-cited <a href=\"http://xkcd.com/936/\">XKCD</a> <a href=\"https://subrabbit.wordpress.com/2011/08/26/how-much-entropy-in-that-password/\">scheme</a> for generating passwords -- string together individual words like \"correcthorsebatterystaple\" --  is no longer good advice.  The password crackers are on to this trick.</p>\n\n<p>The attacker will feed any personal information he has access to about the password creator into the password crackers.  A good password cracker will test names and addresses from the address book, meaningful dates, and any other personal information it has. Postal codes are common appendages.  If it can, the guesser will index the target hard drive and create a dictionary that includes every printable string, including deleted files. If you ever saved an e-mail with your password, or kept it in an obscure file somewhere, or if your program ever stored it in memory, this process will grab it. And it will speed the process of recovering your password.</p>\n\n<p>Last year, Ars Technica <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/05/how-crackers-make-minced-meat-out-of-your-passwords/\">gave three experts</a> a 16,000-entry encrypted password file, and asked them to break as many as possible. The winner got 90% of them, the loser 62% -- in a few hours.  It's the same sort of thing we saw in <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/security/2012/08/passwords-under-assault/\">2012</a>, <a href=\"https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2007/01/choosing_secure.html\">2007</a>, and earlier.  If there's any new news, it's that this kind of thing is getting easier faster than people think.</p>\n\n<p>Pretty much anything that can be remembered can be cracked.</p>\n\n<p>There's still one scheme that works.  Back in 2008, I <a href=\"https://www.schneier.com/essay-246.html\">described</a> the \"Schneier scheme\":</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>So if you want your password to be hard to guess, you should choose something that this process will miss. My advice is to take a sentence and turn it into a password. Something like \"This little piggy went to market\" might become \"tlpWENT2m\". That nine-character password won't be in anyone's dictionary. Of course, don't use this one, because I've written about it. Choose your own sentence -- something personal.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Here are <a href=\"https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/06/a_really_good_a.html\">some examples</a>:</p>\n\n<ul><li>WIw7,mstmsritt... = When I was seven, my sister threw my stuffed rabbit in the toilet.\n\n<p/></li><li>Wow...doestcst = Wow, does that couch smell terrible.\n\n<p/></li><li>Ltime@go-inag~faaa! = Long time ago in a galaxy not far away at all.\n\n<p/></li><li>uTVM,TPw55:utvm,tpwstillsecure = Until this very moment, these passwords were still secure.</li></ul>\n\n<p>You get the idea. Combine a personally memorable sentence with some personally memorable tricks to modify that sentence into a password to create a lengthy password.  Of course, the site has to accept all of those non-alpha-numeric characters and an arbitrarily long password.  Otherwise, it's much harder.</p>\n\n<p>Even better is to use random unmemorable alphanumeric passwords (with symbols, if the site will allow them), and a password manager like <a href=\"https://www.schneier.com/passsafe.html\">Password Safe</a> to create and store them. Password Safe includes a random password generation function.  Tell it how many characters you want -- twelve is my default -- and it'll give you passwords like y.)v_|.7)7Bl, B3h4_[%}kgv), and QG6,FN4nFAm_.  The program supports cut and paste, so you're not actually typing those characters very much.  I'm recommending Password Safe for Windows because I wrote the first version, know the person currently in charge of the code, and trust its security.  There are ports of Password Safe to other OSs, but I had nothing to do with those.  There are also other password managers out there, if you want to shop around.</p>\n\n<p>There's more to passwords than simply choosing a good one:</p>\n\n<ol><li>Never reuse a password you care about.  Even if you choose a secure password, the site it's for could leak it because of its own incompetence.  You don't want someone who gets your password for one application or site to be able to use it for another.</li>\n\n<p/><li>Don't bother updating your password regularly.  Sites that require 90-day -- or whatever -- password upgrades do more harm than good.  Unless you think your password might be compromised, don't change it.</li>\n\n<p/><li>Beware the \"secret question.\"  You don't want a backup system for when you forget your password to be easier to break than your password.  Really, it's smart to use a password manager.  Or to write your passwords down on a piece of paper and <i>secure that piece of paper</i>.</li>\n\n<p/><li>One more piece of advice: if a  site offers two-factor authentication, seriously consider using it.  It's almost certainly a security improvement.</li></ol>\n\n<p><i>This essay <a href=\"http://boingboing.net/2014/02/25/choosing-a-secure-password.html\">previously appeared</a> on BoingBoing.</i></p>\n    \n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n    \n\t<p class=\"entry-tags\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.schneier.com/cgi-bin/mt/mt-search.cgi?search=cracking&amp;__mode=tag&amp;IncludeBlogs=2&amp;limit=10&amp;page=1\" rel=\"tag\">cracking</a>, <a href=\"https://www.schneier.com/cgi-bin/mt/mt-search.cgi?search=essays&amp;__mode=tag&amp;IncludeBlogs=2&amp;limit=10&amp;page=1\" rel=\"tag\">essays</a>, <a href=\"https://www.schneier.com/cgi-bin/mt/mt-search.cgi?search=passwords&amp;__mode=tag&amp;IncludeBlogs=2&amp;limit=10&amp;page=1\" rel=\"tag\">passwords</a>, <a href=\"https://www.schneier.com/cgi-bin/mt/mt-search.cgi?search=security%20awareness&amp;__mode=tag&amp;IncludeBlogs=2&amp;limit=10&amp;page=1\" rel=\"tag\">security awareness</a>, <a href=\"https://www.schneier.com/cgi-bin/mt/mt-search.cgi?search=usability&amp;__mode=tag&amp;IncludeBlogs=2&amp;limit=10&amp;page=1\" rel=\"tag\">usability</a></p>\n\n\n\t\n\t<p class=\"posted\"><a href=\"https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2014/03/choosing_secure_1.html\">Posted on March  3, 2014 at  7:48 AM</a>\n\t \u2022 \n\t221 Comments\n\t\n\t</p>\n\t<aside><p class=\"share\" id=\"share005263\"/></aside>\n\t</div></div></body></html>"}, "15431327": {"score": 2, "comments": ["<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=15416615\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=15416615</a>"], "time": "2017-10-09 06:04:49", "url": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/local/2017/10/06/her-disability-check-was-gone-and-now-the-only-option-left-was-also-one-of-the-worst/?tid=sm_tw&utm_term=.edc1b277791b", "text": "<html><body><div><div class=\"span8 marT30 col\">\n<p><span class=\"firstcharacter\">I</span>t had been a bad night.

She put on her glasses, walked outside past the shower she kept in case she got running water and crossed the street to see if Bobby was awake yet.</p>\n<p>\u201cWould you like a cup of coffee?\u201d he asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cI guess we\u2019ll drink that and go ahead and take that stuff over there to Tommy\u2019s,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>\u201cAin\u2019t got much,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d she sighed irritably, \u201cI tried to get you to go [digging] yesterday, and you wouldn\u2019t go.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was beat,\u201d he said. \u201cYesterday was my rest day.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy rest day will be when I\u2019m six foot in the ground.\u201d</p>\n<p>She looked at the trailer belonging to Kenneth, her brother-in-law, owner of the barking dog, and shook her head.</p>\n<p>\u201cBark, bark, bark,\u201d she said. \u201cDay in and day out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI block that stuff right out of my mind,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>Donna Jean wished she could, like she wished she could block out so many other things. Her parents had warned her that life wouldn\u2019t be easy. There would be times she wouldn\u2019t have enough money. But she hadn\u2019t thought that would be her entire life, that she would be 51 and living like this still, some days fantasizing about an amount of money that would barely register with many people but would mean everything to her. Five hundred dollars. What would she do if she found some Virginia snakeroot \u2014 rare, fragile and worth $120 per pound \u2014 and made $500? What would she buy? There would be a bed. A real one. Not just a mattress on the floor. And a cabinet, too, something small. But instead, she slept where she slept, she had what she had, and that dog wouldn\u2019t stop barking.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you do something about that barking-ass dog down there?\u201d she yelled at Kenneth when he came by. \u201cI\u2019m going to turn it loose!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I catch you on that property \u2014 \u201d Kenneth began.</p>\n<p>\u201cKenneth, get out of my face!\u201d she said. \u201cBobby and them might take it from you, but I don\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey!\u201d Bobby, sitting on the porch in a camping chair, told Donna Jean. \u201cKeep your mouth shut.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m <em>tired</em>,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery day, every day, every day. I can\u2019t sit on my porch or nothing else.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is not going to be here,\u201d Bobby said. \u201cZip it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve got health problems,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s he got?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve got health problems, too,\u201d said Kenneth, who spent years on disability before the government cut off his benefits.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy wife\u2019s got health problems, too,\u201d Bobby said. \u201cGo home.

Let's fix this.</p>\n<p>First, the AngularJS module. Create a new file <code>client/app.js</code> and define the module:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">angular.module(<span class=\"hljs-string\">'forum'</span>, [<span class=\"hljs-string\">'angular-meteor'</span>]);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Next, create the forum template <code>views/forum.html</code>. This is going to be the common layout used by all subpages.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\"><span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;<span class=\"hljs-name\">div</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">class</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"forum\"</span>&gt;</span>\n  FORUM\n<span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;/<span class=\"hljs-name\">div</span>&gt;</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>At this point you can run the app.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">$ meteor\n</code></pre>\n<p>Open a browser and navigate to <code>http://localhost:3000</code> . You should see the text <code>FORUM</code>.<br/>\nThis is all great, but not very impressive yet.</p>\n<p>Let's create the template <code>views/pages/topics.html</code> to display the forum topics.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\"><span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;<span class=\"hljs-name\">div</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">class</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"page\"</span>&gt;</span>\n  <span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;<span class=\"hljs-name\">h1</span>&gt;</span>Topics<span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;/<span class=\"hljs-name\">h1</span>&gt;</span>\n  <span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;<span class=\"hljs-name\">div</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">ng-repeat</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"topic in topics\"</span>&gt;</span>\n    <span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;<span class=\"hljs-name\">a</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">ui-sref</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"topic({topicId: topic._id})\"</span>&gt;</span>{{ topic.name }}<span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;/<span class=\"hljs-name\">a</span>&gt;</span>\n  <span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;/<span class=\"hljs-name\">div</span>&gt;</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;/<span class=\"hljs-name\">div</span>&gt;</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>To see this template in action, we will install the de-facto routing solution in AngularJS, <code>angular-ui-router</code>, and set up some basic routes. Either exit meteor with <code>Ctrl+C</code>, or open another command prompt, and navigate to your apps root directory.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">meteor add angularui:angular-ui-router\n</code></pre>\n<p>Our <code>app.js</code> is a great place to set up routing and controllers. However, you may want to put these into different files in a real-life application. If you do so, make sure to pay attention to the order of how Meteor loads files. Place the module definition into a file under <code>client/lib/</code>, otherwise it will be loaded after the<br/>\ncontroller/directive/etc. definitions triggering an AngularJS exception.</p>\n<p>Replace the contents of <code>app.js</code> with:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">angular.module(<span class=\"hljs-string\">'forum'</span>, [<span class=\"hljs-string\">'angular-meteor'</span>, <span class=\"hljs-string\">'ui.router'</span>])\n.config(<span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span>(<span class=\"hljs-params\">$urlRouterProvider, $stateProvider</span>)</span>{\n\n  <span class=\"hljs-comment\">// Set the default route </span>\n  $urlRouterProvider\n    .when(<span class=\"hljs-string\">'/'</span>, <span class=\"hljs-string\">'/topics'</span>)\n    .otherwise(<span class=\"hljs-string\">'/topics'</span>);\n\n  <span class=\"hljs-comment\">// Add states</span>\n  $stateProvider.state(<span class=\"hljs-string\">'topics'</span>, {\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">url</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">'/topics'</span>,\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">templateUrl</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">'views/pages/topics.html'</span>\n  });\n})\n.run(<span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span>(<span class=\"hljs-params\">$state</span>)</span>{\n  <span class=\"hljs-comment\">// We inject $state here to initialize ui.router </span>\n})\n</code></pre>\n<p>Before you can see the topics list in the browser, <code>views/forum.html</code> needs a little tweaking.<br/>\nAn element with <code>ui-view</code> attribute is required to render the template associated with the current route.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\"><span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;<span class=\"hljs-name\">div</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">class</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"forum\"</span>&gt;</span>\n  <span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;<span class=\"hljs-name\">div</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">class</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"page-container\"</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">ui-view</span>&gt;</span>\n  <span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;/<span class=\"hljs-name\">div</span>&gt;</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;/<span class=\"hljs-name\">div</span>&gt;</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>Navigate to <code>http://localhost:3000</code> now, and notice how it redirects instantly to the topics page.<br/>\nHowever, we don't have any topics yet. Since we will probably want to add or remove topics later,<br/>\nit's a good idea to store them in a database.</p>\n<p>Meteor uses MongoDB for persistent storage.<br/>\nYou can define MongoDB collections with <code>new Meteor.Collection(collectionName)</code>.<br/>\nThis should be present both on the client and server side, so let's create a directory called <code>common</code>, and place this into <code>common/db.js</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">Topics = <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">new</span> Meteor.Collection(<span class=\"hljs-string\">'Topics'</span>);\n</code></pre>\n<p>In Meteor, publication is the way you construct a set of data to send to a client.<br/>\nYou call <code>Meteor.publish</code> with the name of the dataset, and a callback function that may or may not have arguments and returns a MongoDB cursor. Meteor uses some magic behind the scenes to read changes from the MongoDB oplog (or polls the database if oplog is not set up properly) and updates the cursor when data is added, removed or modified.</p>\n<p>A publication should be defined in a server-only file, so let's create a directory called <code>server</code>. Every JavaScript file you place here will run only on the server.<br/>\nLet's create the file <code>server/publications.js</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">Meteor.publish(<span class=\"hljs-string\">'topics'</span>, <span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span>(<span class=\"hljs-params\"/>)</span>{\n  <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">return</span> Topics.find();\n});\n\nMeteor.publish(<span class=\"hljs-string\">'topic'</span>, <span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span>(<span class=\"hljs-params\">id</span>)</span>{\n  check(id, <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">String</span>);\n  <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">return</span> Topics.find({<span class=\"hljs-attr\">_id</span>: id});\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will define two publications, one for all the topics, and one for a single topic requested by id. Also, let's insert some topics by default if the collection is empty. Put this in <code>server/defaults.js</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">if</span> (Topics.find().count() === <span class=\"hljs-number\">0</span>) {\n  _.each([<span class=\"hljs-string\">'General Discussion'</span>, <span class=\"hljs-string\">'Tutorials'</span>, <span class=\"hljs-string\">'Help'</span>],\n  <span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span>(<span class=\"hljs-params\">topicName</span>)</span>{\n    Topics.insert({<span class=\"hljs-attr\">name</span>: topicName});\n  });\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>A client initiates a subscription which connects to a publication, and receives that data. Let's see how to do this using Angular-Meteor. In <code>client/app.js</code>, add a controller option to the definition of the <code>topics</code> state called <code>TopicsContoller</code>, and define the controller after <code>.run()</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"hljs-comment\">// ...</span>\n  $stateProvider.state(<span class=\"hljs-string\">'topics'</span>, {\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">url</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">'/topics'</span>,\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">templateUrl</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">'views/pages/topics.html'</span>,\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">controller</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">'TopicsContoller'</span>\n  });\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">// ...</span>\n.controller(<span class=\"hljs-string\">'TopicsContoller'</span>, <span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span>(<span class=\"hljs-params\">$scope</span>)</span>{\n  $scope.subscribe(<span class=\"hljs-string\">'topics'</span>);\n  $scope.helpers({\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">topics</span>: <span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span>(<span class=\"hljs-params\"/>) </span>{\n      <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">return</span> Topics.find({}, {<span class=\"hljs-attr\">sort</span>: {<span class=\"hljs-attr\">name</span>:<span class=\"hljs-number\">1</span>}});\n    }\n  });\n})\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here we subscribe to the <code>topics</code> publication, and add a helper called <code>topics</code> that simply returns a MongoDB cursor to the list of topics sorted by name. From the AngularJS perspective, this will be a simple array available in the <code>$scope.topics</code> variable.</p>\n<p>View your forum in the browser. You should see the three topics under the heading. However, if you try to click on them, nothing happens. This is because we haven't defined our <code>topic</code> state yet. Let's do that and define the <code>TopicController</code> as well.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"hljs-comment\">// ...</span>\n  $stateProvider.state(<span class=\"hljs-string\">'topic'</span>, {\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">url</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">'/topic/:topicId'</span>,\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">templateUrl</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">'views/pages/topic.html'</span>,\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">controller</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">'TopicContoller'</span>\n  });\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">// ...</span>\n.controller(<span class=\"hljs-string\">'TopicContoller'</span>, <span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span>(<span class=\"hljs-params\">$scope, $stateParams</span>)</span>{\n  $scope.subscribe(<span class=\"hljs-string\">'topic'</span>, <span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span>(<span class=\"hljs-params\"/>)</span>{ \n    <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">return</span> [$stateParams.topicId];\n  });\n  $scope.helpers({\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">topic</span>: <span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span>(<span class=\"hljs-params\"/>)</span>{\n      <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">return</span> Topics.findOne({<span class=\"hljs-attr\">_id</span>: $stateParams.topicId});\n    }\n  });\n})\n</code></pre>\n<p>It's pretty straight-forward, but note that we have to use a function to pass the id argument to the <code>topic</code> publication, and return a single topic with <code>findOne</code> instead of <code>find</code>.</p>\n<p>The template <code>views/pages/topic.html</code> will be quite simple, but don't worry, we'll add the list of threads soon.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\"><span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;<span class=\"hljs-name\">div</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">class</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"page\"</span>&gt;</span>\n  <span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;<span class=\"hljs-name\">h1</span>&gt;</span>{{ topic.name }}<span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;/<span class=\"hljs-name\">h1</span>&gt;</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;/<span class=\"hljs-name\">div</span>&gt;</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>To use the forum, we have to be able to identify users.<br/>\nMeteor has some useful packages for authentication:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>accounts-base</code>: This package implements the basic functions necessary for user accounts and lets other packages register login services.</li>\n<li><code>accounts-password</code>: A login service that enables secure password-based login.</li>\n<li><code>dotansimha:accounts-ui-angular</code>: AngularJS wrapper for Meteor's Account-UI package.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let's install these:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">$ meteor add accounts-base accounts-password dotansimha:accounts-ui-angular\n</code></pre>\n<p>To use <code>dotansimha:accounts-ui-angular</code>, your AngularJS module should list<br/>\n<code>accounts.ui</code> as a dependency:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">angular.module(<span class=\"hljs-string\">'forum'</span>, [<span class=\"hljs-string\">'angular-meteor'</span>, <span class=\"hljs-string\">'ui.router'</span>, <span class=\"hljs-string\">'accounts.ui'</span>])\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now we can add authentication, signup, forgot password and change password features with a single line. A good place would be in <code>views/forum.html</code>, since it's the root layout for all of our pages:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\"><span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;<span class=\"hljs-name\">div</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">class</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"forum\"</span>&gt;</span>\n  <span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;<span class=\"hljs-name\">login-buttons</span>&gt;</span><span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;/<span class=\"hljs-name\">login-buttons</span>&gt;</span>\n  <span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;<span class=\"hljs-name\">div</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">ui-view</span>&gt;</span>\n  <span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;/<span class=\"hljs-name\">div</span>&gt;</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;/<span class=\"hljs-name\">div</span>&gt;</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>Nice!

kinetic energy of the gun, allowing for the firing of the next round far faster than would be possible by manually releasing the trigger.\u00a0 They are sold for as little as $100, and some <a

This is roughly equal to our estimate for the capacity of all living biological human intelligence ... This state of computation in the early 2030s will not represent the Singularity, however, because it does not yet correspond to a profound expansion of our intelligence. By the mid-2040s, however, that one thousand dollars' worth of computation will be equal to 10<sup>26</sup> cps, so the intelligence created per year (at a total cost of about $10<sup>12</sup>) will be about one billion times more powerful than all human intelligence today. That <i>will</i> indeed represent a profound change, and it is for that reason that I set the date for the Singularity\u2014representing a profound and disruptive transformation in human capability\u2014as 2045.\"</span></li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-Kurzweil_2001-23\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-Kurzweil_2001_23-0\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><cite id=\"CITEREFKurzweil2001\" class=\"citation\"><a href=\"/wiki/Raymond_Kurzweil\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Raymond Kurzweil\">Kurzweil, Raymond</a> (2001), <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://lifeboat.com/ex/law.of.accelerating.returns\">\"The Law of Accelerating Returns\"</a>, <i>Nature Physics</i>, Lifeboat Foundation, <b>4</b> (7): 507, <a href=\"/wiki/Bibcode\" title=\"Bibcode\">Bibcode</a>:<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008NatPh...4..507B\">2008NatPh...4..507B</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Digital_object_identifier\" title=\"Digital object identifier\">doi</a>:<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"//doi.org/10.1038%2Fnphys1010\">10.1038/nphys1010</a><span class=\"reference-accessdate\">, retrieved <span class=\"nowrap\">2007-08-07</span></span></cite><span title=\"ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fen.wikipedia.org%3ATechnological+singularity&amp;rft.atitle=The+Law+of+Accelerating+Returns&amp;rft.aufirst=Raymond&amp;rft.aulast=Kurzweil&amp;rft.date=2001&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.issue=7&amp;rft.jtitle=Nature+Physics&amp;rft.pages=507&amp;rft.volume=4&amp;rft_id=http%3A%2F%2Flifeboat.com%2Fex%2Flaw.of.accelerating.returns&amp;rft_id=info%3Abibcode%2F2008NatPh...4..507B&amp;rft_id=info%3Adoi%2F10.1038%2Fnphys1010&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal\" class=\"Z3988\"><span>\u00a0</span></span></span></li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-24\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-24\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><i>The Singularity Is Near</i></span></li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-JoyFuture-25\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\">^ <a href=\"#cite_ref-JoyFuture_25-0\"><sup><i><b>a</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-JoyFuture_25-1\"><sup><i><b>b</b></i></sup></a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><cite id=\"CITEREFJoy2000\" class=\"citation\"><a href=\"/wiki/Bill_Joy\" title=\"Bill Joy\">Joy, Bill</a> (April 2000), <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.04/joy.html\">\"Why the future doesn't need us\"</a>, <i><a href=\"/wiki/Wired_(magazine)\" title=\"Wired (magazine)\">Wired Magazine</a></i>, Viking Adult (8.04), <a href=\"/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number\" title=\"International Standard Book Number\">ISBN</a>\u00a0<a href=\"/wiki/Special:BookSources/0-670-03249-2\" title=\"Special:BookSources/0-670-03249-2\">0-670-03249-2</a><span class=\"reference-accessdate\">, retrieved <span class=\"nowrap\">2007-08-07</span></span></cite><span title=\"ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fen.wikipedia.org%3ATechnological+singularity&amp;rft.atitle=Why+the+future+doesn%27t+need+us&amp;rft.aufirst=Bill&amp;rft.aulast=Joy&amp;rft.date=2000-04&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.isbn=0-670-03249-2&amp;rft.issue=8.04&amp;rft.jtitle=Wired+Magazine&amp;rft_id=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wired.com%2Fwired%2Farchive%2F8.04%2Fjoy.html&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal\" class=\"Z3988\"><span>\u00a0</span></span></span></li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-dreyfus-26\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-dreyfus_26-0\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a href=\"#CITEREFDreyfusDreyfus2000\">Dreyfus &amp; Dreyfus 2000</a>, p.\u00a0xiv: 'The truth is that human intelligence can never be replaced with machine intelligence simply because we are not ourselves \"thinking machines\" in the sense in which that term is commonly understood.' <a href=\"#CITEREFHawking1998\">Hawking (1998)</a>: 'Some people say that computers can never show true intelligence whatever that may be.

At the back of our retinas is a complex circuit, from the photoreceptors that ping when a photon hits them, that tickle multiple layers of neurons into life, who then spit their signal out to the rest of the brain (wired backwards, with the neurons sitting in front of the photoreceptors, like trying to watch a TV with the wires hanging in front of the screen). Immediately, the signal splits, some going up to the first \u201cvisual\u2019\u2019 cortex, some down to the brainstem. From these first way-stations, the signal travels onward, deeper into cortex, deeper into the brain. As we charge forward from your retina, we move deep into your brain, from neuron to neuron to neuron.</p><p name=\"639d\" id=\"639d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Take reaching for your phone. Your arm and shoulder muscles variously contract and relax to move your hand from where it was to where your phone is. Neurons in your spinal cord connect directly to these muscles; firing these neurons contracts the muscle. Behind those neurons are other neurons in your spinal cord; further behind them, the neurons in your brain stem and motor cortex. As we pull back from the muscles, we move up and through your brain, from neuron to neuron to neuron.</p><p name=\"8017\" id=\"8017\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">And, somewhere, we hit the loneliest neurons. The neurons the most steps forward from the senses; the most steps back from the muscles. But they are connected to them. To them all, eventually. Shouldn\u2019t this mean we find the activity of the loneliest neurons is related to, well, everything?</p><p name=\"3d9e\" id=\"3d9e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Yes it does.

Yet neural activity in prefrontal cortex seems to know about everything. Neurons there can change their activity according to the past (memory) and the future (upcoming decisions); to the colour and motion of objects in the world; to where the animal is right now. Some, perhaps most, of the neurons in prefrontal cortex even respond to combinations of these things.</p><p name=\"dd65\" id=\"dd65\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Or the loneliest neurons may well be in the obliquely obscure globus pallidus\u200a\u2014\u200aa pale globe of neurons, tucked underneath the striatum, reaching their tendrils into all the other nuclei of the basal ganglia. Far, far from the senses and motion. Yet neurons here have different activity according to how the arm is about to moved; and respond differently to when a reward is delivered to when it is not.</p><p name=\"e112\" id=\"e112\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">Wherever they are, when we record activity from the loneliest neurons, we indeed see they respond to both sensory and motor events, to both the past and future.</p></div></div></body></html>"}, "15429807": {"score": 226, "comments": ["Pittsburgher here.

I think that&#x27;s led to a great deal of redundancy and inefficiency, which has raised the cost of these protections beyond what most manufacturers could bear.  We need to move to a system where these costs are shared by all Americans, and by all who buy American products, in a more efficient manner.

Without these steps it will be difficult for you to earn a reasonable amount of money every month. Usually people don\u2019t know what to do after selecting an affiliate program and they simply fail.\n\n</p><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-layout=\"in-article\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-5880306699717979\" data-ad-slot=\"9578262030\"/>\n\n\n\n\n<i><b><span>Following are these necessary steps:</span></b></i>\n\n<span><b>Step 1:</b></span><p>\nFirst of all, set your objective. This means set the amount of money you want to earn every month through affiliate marketing. If you are doing this business as a part time business, then you will need less effort as you want to earn less. On the other hand if you are relying on this business to meet your needs, then you should be prepared for hard work, sometimes working on holidays and giving at least 8-10 hours a day.\n\n</p><span><b><i>Step 2:</i></b></span><p>\nSearch the affiliate programs to select a market to work. There are usually many types of markets for example, health, entertainment, sports etc.</p><p>\nChoose the market that is hot and suits your interests.\n</p><p>\nWhile selecting a market, look at the benefits they are offering to the affiliate markets. Try to select the market that is hot and which is offering a good profit share to their affiliates.\n\n</p><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-layout=\"in-article\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-5880306699717979\" data-ad-slot=\"9578262030\"/>\n\n\n\n\n<span><b><i>Step 3:</i></b></span><p>\nBefore selecting a merchant to be an affiliate for, look at its history. How many affiliates does this merchant already have?\u00a0 \u00a0What are the opinions of the affiliates with whom he is working? By answering these questions, you will know a lot about the reputation of your merchant. Avoid new merchants and join those who are strong in the market and have been in business for many years with success. It will be easier to promote the products of the merchants who are senior in the field. Customers will feel more at ease to make a purchase from a merchant that has been around for awhile.\n</p><b><i><br/></i></b>\n<b><i>Step 4:</i></b><p>\nWhen you have chosen a specific market, now it is time to select a product. You will definitely want to add all of the products at the beginning, but it is advised not to do this in the start. If you choose more products in the beginning, you will not be able to focus.\u00a0 Your attention will be diverted to different products. So it is better to choose one product to get the best result from it.\u00a0 When you have started getting the sales you desire and feel comfortable,\u00a0 then you can add more products.\n\n</p><span><b><i>Step 5:</i></b></span><p>\nMake your own website. Your website is meant for the business. So it must look professional. It should not be over loaded with heavy graphics and lots of flashy banners. Simple is the best. Try to use light colors. Make a nice header to show your company name and theme. The site navigation must be simple and easy. People should not have any difficulty in searching for a specific page or information. Otherwise they will not re-visit your website.\n\n\n</p><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-layout=\"in-article\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-5880306699717979\" data-ad-slot=\"9578262030\"/>\n\n\n\n<b><i>Step 6:</i></b><p>\nIf you don\u2019t want to invest money in having your website designed for you, then you can get free website design templates.\u00a0 There are many websites on the internet that are offering free website templates. Just visit these sites and choose the template that you like.\u00a0 Fill the template with you own content and upload it on your server.\n\n</p><span><i><b>Step 7:</b></i></span><p>\nYour website should have a search box on every page to search your website. This will be a great help for the visitors that want to search a specific product or information on your website.\n\n</p><b><i><span>Step 8:</span></i></b><p>\nYou can write articles and publish them in the free article directories. You can embed your affiliate links in the text of your articles. If your articles are well formatted, informative and the article directory has large traffic, then you can expect some good traffic to your affiliate links. And you know that more traffic on your affiliate links will result in more sales through your affiliate links.\n\n</p>\n\n\n<ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-layout=\"in-article\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-5880306699717979\" data-ad-slot=\"9578262030\"/>\n\n\n\n\n<b><i><span>Conclusion</span></i></b><p>\nAfter joining an affiliate program, you are required to choose the right market, right merchant and right product. After that, choose the right methods to promote your products to become successful as an affiliate.</p></div>\n</div>\n</div></body></html>"}, "15431350": {"score": 3, "comments": [], "time": "2017-10-09 06:12:42", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/tech-companies-are-embarrassing-themselves-with-how-they-handle-fake-news-2017-10", "text": "<html><body><div><div>\n  <p>\n    <span class=\"KonaFilter image-container display-table float_right image on-image\" data-post-image=\"\">\n      <img src=\"http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/59d7cdc93e7bfd1d008b4768-1454/mandalay%20bay%20hotel%20window%20paddock.jpg\" alt=\"mandalay bay hotel window paddock\" data-mce-source=\"AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez\" data-mce-caption=\"An investigator works in the room at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino where a gunman opened fire from on a music festival Tuesday, Oct. 3, 2017, in Las Vegas.\"/>\n      <span class=\"source-only source\">AP\n  Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez</span>\n    </span>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n  If you searched for \"Las Vegas Shooter\" or \"Stephen Paddock\" on\n  YouTube after Sunday's\u00c2\u00a0mass shooting,\u00c2\u00a0here's\u00c2\u00a0a\n  sampling of some of the videos\u00c2\u00a0you would have seen:\n</p>\n  <p>\n  One video was titled \"Proof Las Vegas Shooting Was a\u00c2\u00a0FALSE\n  FLAG\u00c2\u00a0Attack - Shooter on 4th Floor\"\n</p>\n  <p>\n  Another: \"Las Vegas Shooting Narrative Debunked in 3 Videos\"\n</p>\n  <p>\n  Yet another: \"Las Vegas (Antifa?)

A source close to YouTube\n  told me the earlier-than-planned rollout of the\n  change\u00c2\u00a0was\u00c2\u00a0in response to criticism of how it handled\n  the Las Vegas shooting videos.\n</p>\n  <p>\n  It's been 11 months since the 2016 US election, when\n  the\u00c2\u00a0plague\u00c2\u00a0of fake news and abuse on internet platforms\n  became a mainstream problem. Since then, Facebook, Google, and\n  Twitter have all made attempts to change their algorithms and\n  services to combat the problem. But despite their efforts and\n  all\u00c2\u00a0that\u00c2\u00a0time, it still\u00c2\u00a0requires a journalist or\n  noisy critic to point out a problem\u00c2\u00a0before something gets\n  fixed.\n</p>\n  <p>\n  Then come the half-hearted apologies and promises to do better.\n  And the cycle repeats itself.\n</p>\n  <p>\n  In April, for example, Google said it <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/google-launches-new-search-tools-to-combat-fake-news-2017-4\">\n  made changes to its search algorithm</a> to favor authoritative\n  sources for news, just like YouTube did this week. Facebook has\n  made several changes to combat fake news like <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-how-to-spot-fake-news-2017-4\">\n  automated tips for spotting fake news</a> and a new pop-up window\n  <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/05/facebook-article-information-button/\">\n  that gives you information on the news source you're reading</a>.\n</p>\n  <p>\n  And yet, all these platforms continue to screw up.

Another route, however, is the Peter Thiel-ian <a href=\"http://zerotoonebook.com/\">zero-to-one</a> approach: see if it\u2019s possible to use these tools to create industries that currently do not exist. Hence, let us take a detour along that path, and see some of the more underappreciated and interesting applications that smart contracts can provide.</p>\n<h3>Hashcash meets Proof of Stake</h3>\n<p>Although proof of work is today known primarily for its function in blockchain consensus algorithms, its original function was in fact something quite different. The first major use of proof of work was Adam Back\u2019s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashcash\">Hashcash</a>, a protocol that tries to fight email spam by making spam emails more expensive to generate. Proof of stake is today similarly best known for its applications in blockchain consensus, and the theory is that because of the way modern proof of stake works \u2013 allowing users to <em>put at stake</em> large amounts of economic resources for security without, in the normal case, <em>actually spending them</em> \u2013 it could potentially be vastly more efficient. So this leads to an interesting question: can we apply these advantages to make a more efficient version of Hashcash using proof of stake as well?</p>\n<p>Let us start by describing the problem. The basic principle behind Hashcash rests on the idea that email today tends to be split into two categories: desirable email (\u201cham\u201d), which people spend a reasonably large amount of effort writing and which people derive high value from reading, and undesirable email (\u201cspam\u201d), which people normally spend a much smaller amount of effort per email writing and which people derive a <em>negative</em> amount of value from reading. Hence, the theory goes, by attaching a small mandatory cost to each email sent, the \u201cham\u201d can get through with only slight additional burden, whereas \u201cspam\u201d would be made entirely unprofitable. This \u201ccost\u201d is paid in the form of electricity and computational effort which is used to solve a mathematical puzzle that can be quickly verified by the recipient\u2019s client before showing the email to the recipient.</p>\n<p>The problem with this approach is threefold. First, spammers may simply switch to a strategy of spending slightly more effort on each email (eg. spending five seconds of human labor per message to make it more likely to catch the reader\u2019s attention or bypass spam filters), and the threshold of computational work that would be needed to actually stop the majority of spam would be quite large. Second, spammers are more professional and have better access to specialized computer hardware that can quickly and cheaply solve these computational puzzles, so a cost that might be five cents to the ordinary user might only be a tenth of a cent to a spammer. Third, as this <a href=\"http://craphound.com/spamsolutions.txt\">now-famous checklist</a> listing flaws in popular proposed solutions to email spam points out, it is considered highly desirable to have a system where \u201csending email should be free\u201d.</p>\n<p>So here is a proof-of-stake alternative. When you send an email, you do not need to compute an expensive computational puzzle; instead, send a transaction to the blockchain which creates a contract containing some amount of money as a security deposit. As part of the email, send a private key to the recipient, which the recipient can submit into the contract to destroy the deposit (or donate it to a standardized charity) <b>if they want to</b>. If the deposit is not destroyed for some number of days, it is refunded to the sender. Note that there would be no gain to the recipient in destroying the deposit \u2013 the only motivation to do so would be pure spite. As a result, we get an asymmetry: the average cost for normal people to send an email would be small, because the recipient would only click \u201cReport Spam\u201d in the rare case that <em>they</em> are malicious, but the average cost for spammers would be quite high indeed \u2013 and specialized hardware asymmetries would not help spammers one bit.</p>\n<p>One could see deposits going as high as a dollar in size, and one can even adopt a graduated scheme: senders can send whatever deposits they want above some minimum, but the <em>level of notification</em> that the recipient sees would depend on the exact amount. If it\u2019s $0.1, then it\u2019s just an email in their mailbox. If it\u2019s $1, then a few phone notifications. If it\u2019s $500, then their phone would ring at maximum volume overriding all other settings \u2013 but the sender best be prepared to pay the price if the recipient deems the sender\u2019s intrusion unjustified.</p>\n<p>One can create more advanced versions of this scheme that do not require sending a transaction to create a new deposit for each email; one can imagine a scheme where the sender sends out many keys to destroy portions of the same security deposit, alongside signatures saying that those keys are valid, and recipients publish the signatures (but not the keys!) to a Whisper-like channel allowing them to quickly sample and make sure that a particular deposit is not \u201cover-subscribed\u201d with destruction keys (one precise mechanism for doing this is to only treat signatures containing an index from 1 to N as valid, and add a rule that states that two signatures with the same index can be submitted to destroy the entire deposit with 10% transferred to the submitter; hence, one can be fairly sure that at most N signatures for that deposit exist). This would reduce the transaction load to roughly something like one transaction per email sender per year. In any case, smart contracts offer near-infinite room for creativity in optimizing the details.</p>\n<h3>Prediction Markets and Reddit</h3>\n<p>One of the largest debates in online communities like Reddit is the question of exactly how much centralized moderation is justified. One view is that the very power of the internet comes in large part from its egalitarian decentralized nature, and the fact that no single party has a higher class of authority than any other. Some people may be more influential than others, but (i) that is a difference of degree and not a categorical distinction of class, and (ii) it is fundamentally the audience\u2019s choice to be influenced. The other view is that without centralized moderation, communities inevitably collapse into mediocrity and chaos of the undesirable kind; essentially, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September\">Eternal September</a>, and so having a small number of users ultimately in charge is, as is in many places the case, a \u201cnecessary evil\u201d.</p>\n<p>In practice, community voting moderation is quite powerful, but the centralist view also seems to have some merit. Although comments that a community does not want to see do eventually get voted down, at least on Reddit specifically the process takes time, and there is still a period of one or two hours during which such content remains on the front page. Within a voting framework, to some extent this is unavoidable: if it was possible for a barrage of downvotes to very quickly remove content from the front page, that itself would turn into a censorship vector for vocal minorities. However, what if there was a third way to solve this problem, by using our favorite governance mechanism: <a href=\"https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/08/21/introduction-futarchy/\">prediction markets</a>?</p>\n<p>Prediction markets have so far, including by myself, often been introduced as a governance mechanism that could one day be employed for very large-scale decisions: whether or not we should bail out the banks, hire or fire a particular CEO, or enter a particular trade agreement. However, perhaps it might be better to introduce prediction markets into the world as a tool for decisions which are far more small-scale and non-threatening \u2013 perhaps on the scale of hundreds or tens of dollars, or even ten cents.</p>\n<p>One could imagine a design that works as follows. Rather than simply being votes, upvotes and downvotes to a comment on a hypothetical PredictionReddit would be bets on a prediction market specific to that comment. The prediction market would be seeded by a mandatory bet that would need to be made by the person making the comment that their comment will be accepted as good; from there, upvotes and downvotes would shift the \u201cprice\u201d of the market depending on how people vote. 99% of the time, the market would have no effect except that comments with high prices would be shown more prominently on the interface; the remaining 1% of the time, however, the comment would be submitted to a meta-moderation panel, which would vote on whether the comment is good or bad (or perhaps some score in between), and the participants in the prediction market would be compensated appropriately based on how well they predicted this score.</p>\n<p>The meta-moderation panel could in principle be quite large; potentially every single participant in the community could be included, provided an effective anti-sybil mechanism was in place. Even a <a href=\"https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/03/28/schellingcoin-a-minimal-trust-universal-data-feed/\">SchellingCoin oracle</a> could be used. It also does not have to be the case that 99% of markets are discarded; one could instead have a model where <em>all</em> markets are processed, but only a small portion of the meta-moderation panel sees each individual post; the number of people need only be large enough that they cannot practically collude for the purpose of insider trading the prediction markets. Another alternative is to have the size or probability of meta-moderation be proportional to the volume of the market, so that the posts that receive the most attention are the ones where the stakes are highest. In any case, this particular means of combining Reddit and cryptocurrency seems at least a bit more promising than simply integrating the ability to express condolences for someone\u2019s death <a href=\"http://hackingdistributed.com/2014/12/17/changetip-must-die/\">by micro-tipping their relatives three cents</a>.</p>\n<p>In principle, either of these two models could be extended quite a bit: imagine ads that are more expensive to maintain the more annoying they are to viewers, or a decentralized search engine where anyone can \u201cplug in\u201d their ranking algorithms by participating in the prediction markets, and profiting only if the algorithms are effective. Oleg Andreev\u2019s <a href=\"http://blog.oleganza.com/post/58240549599/contracts-without-trust-or-third-parties\">2-of-2 escrow</a> could be augmented with a reputation system via a prediction market on the probability that the escrow deposit will be destroyed or payment delayed. Just remember, security deposits and prediction markets are essentially equivalent: <b>a prediction market is a security deposit where anyone can challenge and require a higher deposit in response, and anyone else can back the original depositor up, and a security deposit is a prediction market where one particular party is forced to make a mandatory bet</b>.</p>\n<p>Perhaps this is a large part of the potential of what crypto 2.0 technology can offer: bring the internet from simple <em>information technologies</em> to <em>economic information technologies</em> that could potentially radically increase efficiencies, at least in a few sectors of the digital economy, by using incentives to more cleverly elicit the information that we all individually have. In any case, let\u2019s build these tools and find out.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</section>&#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div></body></html>"}, "15429311": {"score": 2, "comments": [], "time": "2017-10-08 21:29:09", "url": "https://medium.com/@copyconstruct/monitoring-in-the-time-of-cloud-native-c87c7a5bfa3e", "text": "<html><body><div><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><h1 name=\"e3ef\" id=\"e3ef\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf--leading graf--title\">Monitoring in the time of Cloud\u00a0Native</h1><p name=\"8181\" id=\"8181\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Note\u200a\u2014\u200aHuge thanks to Jamie Wilkinson and Julius Volz, Google SREs present and past, for reading a draft of this and giving me invaluable suggestions.

Soon enough, if not already, we\u2019ll be at that point where the network and underlying hardware failures have been robustly abstracted away from us, leaving us with the sole responsibility to ensure our <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">application </em>is good enough to piggy bank on top of the latest and greatest in networking and scheduling abstractions.</p><p name=\"3093\" id=\"3093\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">No amount of GIFEE (Google Infrastructure for Everyone Else) or industrial-grade service mesh is going to fix the software we write.

Trusting Kubernetes and friends to do their job makes it more important than ever for us to focus on the vagaries of the performance characteristics of <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">our</em></strong> application and business logic. Application developers now have <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">one job</em>.

While one might argue that these tools suffer from the selfsame problem they assist us in solving\u200a\u2014\u200aviz, the tools themselves are every bit as nascent and emergent as the infrastructural paradigms they help us gain visibility into\u200a\u2014\u200astrong community interest, community driven development and an open governance model do a lot to promote the sustainability and development of these tools.</p><p name=\"6e51\" id=\"6e51\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In addition to a surge in open source tooling, SaaS tooling modeled along the lines of Google, Twitter, and Facebook\u2019s internal tools have emerged to address the real need felt by the the early adopters of cloud native paradigms.

We hear a lot about the \u201cthree pillars of observability\u201d, but what even is Observability and why should we care? What really is the difference between logs and metrics, except where we send them to? We might\u2019ve heard a lot of tracing\u200a\u2014\u200abut how useful can tracing really be if it\u2019s only just a log with some context? Is a metric just a log or trace that occurs too frequently for a backend system to store? Do we <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">really </em>need all three of them?</p><p name=\"a85e\" id=\"a85e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I\u2019ve said this before in one of my posts, but it bears reiterating. It\u2019s tempting, especially when enamored by a new piece of technology that promises the moon, to retrofit our problem space with the solution space of said technology, however minimal the intersection. Before buying or building a tool, it becomes important to evaluate the maximum utility it can provide for the unique set of engineering challenges specific teams face. In order to be able to make better technological choices\u200a\u2014\u200aespecially when it comes down to choosing something as critical as a monitoring stack\u200a\u2014\u200ait becomes absolutely necessary for us to first fully understand:</p><p name=\"8dce\" id=\"8dce\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">\u2014 the strengths and weaknesses of each category of tools\u00a0<br/>\u200a\u2014\u200athe problems they solve<br/>\u200a\u2014\u200athe tradeoffs they make<br/>\u200a\u2014\u200atheir ease of adoption/integration into an existing infrastructure</p><p name=\"6c45\" id=\"6c45\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Most importantly, it becomes important to make sure that we are solving the problems <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">we have, </em>not using the <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">solutions</em> these new crop of tools provide. Starting over from scratch isn\u2019t a luxury most of us enjoy and the most challenging part about modernizing one\u2019s monitoring stack is iteratively evolving it.

In order to rise to these challenges successfully, it becomes <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">necessary </em>to not just change the way we build and operate software, but also to then follow that up with better visibility into our services, which in turn gives us a shorter feedback loop about the performance of our services in production, which in turn enables us to build better services. In order to craft this virtuous cycle, it becomes important to understand what\u2019s Observability and how it differs from Monitoring.</p><figure name=\"2428\" id=\"2428\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Virtuous cycle of better Observability</figcaption></figure><h4 name=\"2011\" id=\"2011\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure\">Monitoring</h4><p name=\"cf27\" id=\"cf27\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">When I type \u201cmonitoring\u201d into Google, the first two results that come up are the following:</p><blockquote name=\"baad\" id=\"baad\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p\">\u2014 observe and check the progress or quality of (something) <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong\">over a period of time</strong>; keep under systematic review.</blockquote><blockquote name=\"7210\" id=\"7210\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote\">\u2014 maintain regular surveillance over.</blockquote><p name=\"fa91\" id=\"fa91\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote\">Monitoring, to me, connotes something that is inherently both <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">failure</em> as well as <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">human </em>centric<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">. </em>Let\u2019s talk a bit more about this because this forms the bedrock of this post.</p><figure name=\"5e0b\" id=\"5e0b\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"/><p name=\"f20c\" id=\"f20c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">In the past, we might\u2019ve first tested our application.</p><figure name=\"c4c7\" id=\"c4c7\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Application Development and Release Lifecycle</figcaption></figure><p name=\"9448\" id=\"9448\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">This might\u2019ve been followed by a QA cycle.</p><figure name=\"4877\" id=\"4877\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Application Development and Release Lifecycle</figcaption></figure><p name=\"822d\" id=\"822d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Then we might\u2019ve released our code, followed by \u201cmonitoring\u201d it.</p><figure name=\"88ad\" id=\"88ad\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Application Development and Release Lifecycle</figcaption></figure><p name=\"96d6\" id=\"96d6\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Followed by leaving a <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">lot </em>to chance.</p><figure name=\"2dcc\" id=\"2dcc\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Application Development and Release Lifecycle</figcaption></figure><p name=\"6174\" id=\"6174\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Now, I honestly don\u2019t think this was how <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">everyone </em>has been managing software lifecycle, but it makes for a good caricature of what\u2019s often considered \u201cthe old way\u201d.</p><p name=\"6e06\" id=\"6e06\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">We \u201cmonitored\u201d something because we expected something to behave a certain way.

Consequences that needed human intervention.</p><p name=\"57ef\" id=\"57ef\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Now I\u2019m not someone who believes that automating everything is a panacea, but the advent of platforms like Kubernetes means that several of the problems that <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">human and failure</em> centric monitoring tools of yore helped \u201cmonitor\u201d are already solved. Health-checking, load balancing and taking failed services out of rotation and so forth are features these platforms provide for free. That\u2019s their primary value prop.</p><p name=\"8fb0\" id=\"8fb0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">With more of the traditional monitoring responsibilities being automated away, \u201cmonitoring\u201d has become\u200a\u2014\u200aor will soon be\u200a\u2014\u200aless <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">human</em> <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">centric</em>. While none of these platforms will truly make a service <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">impregnable </em>to failure, if used correctly, they can help reduce the number of hard failures, leaving us as engineers to contend with the subtle, nebulous, unpredictable behaviors our system can exhibit. The sort of failures that are far less catastrophic but ever more numerous than before.</p><p name=\"b63f\" id=\"b63f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Which then begs the question\u200a\u2014\u200ahow do we design <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">monitoring </em>for such systems?</p><p name=\"c373\" id=\"c373\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">It really isn\u2019t even so much about how to design <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">monitoring </em>for these systems, than how to design the systems<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\"> themselves</em>.</p><p name=\"18ec\" id=\"18ec\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I\u2019d argue that \u201cmonitoring\u201d should <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">still</em> be both hard failure as well as human centric even in this brave new world. The <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">goal </em>of \u201cmonitoring\u201d hasn\u2019t changed, even if the scope has <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">shrunk </em>drastically, and the challenge that now lies ahead of us is identifying and minimizing the bits of \u201cmonitoring\u201d that still remain human centric. We need to design our systems such that only a small sliver of the overall failure domain is now of the hard, urgently human actionable sort.</p><p name=\"e0cc\" id=\"e0cc\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">But there\u2019s a paradox. Minimizing the number of \u201chard, predictable\u201d failure modes doesn\u2019t in any way mean that the system itself as a whole is any simpler. In other words, even as infrastructure management becomes more automated and requiring less human elbow grease, application lifecycle management is becoming harder. As the number of hard failure modes shrink at the expense of a drastic rise in implicit failure modes and <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">overall</em> complexity, \u201cmonitoring\u201d every failure explicitly becomes infeasible and also unnecessary.</p><h4 name=\"dbf8\" id=\"dbf8\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">Observability</h4><p name=\"532d\" id=\"532d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Observability, in my opinion, is really about being able to understand how a system is behaving in production. If \u201cmonitoring\u201d is best suited to report the overall health of systems, \u201cobservability\u201d, on the other hand, aims to provide highly granular insights into the behavior of systems along with rich context, perfect for providing visibility into <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">implicit failure modes</em> and on the fly generation of information required for debugging. Monitoring is being on the lookout for failures, which in turn requires us to be able to predict these failures proactively. An observable system is one that exposes enough <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">data</em> about itself so that<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\"> generating information </em>(finding answers to questions yet to be formulated) and easily accessing this information becomes simple.</p><h4 name=\"e08f\" id=\"e08f\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">An interlude\u200a\u2014\u200aBlackbox Monitoring</h4><p name=\"515b\" id=\"515b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">For the uninitiated, blackbox monitoring refers to the category of monitoring derived by treating the system as a blackbox and examining it from the outside. While some believe that with more sophisticated tooling at our disposal blackbox monitoring is a thing of the past, I\u2019d argue that blackbox monitoring still has its place, what with large parts of core business and infrastructural components being outsourced to third-party vendors. While the amount of control we might have over the performance of the vendor might be limited, having <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">visibility</em> into how services we own are impacted by the vagaries of outsourced components becomes exceedingly crucial insofar as it affects our system\u2019s performance as a whole.</p><figure name=\"00cd\" id=\"00cd\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Blackbox monitoring</figcaption></figure><p name=\"ffb4\" id=\"ffb4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Even outside of third-party integrations, treating our own systems as blackboxes might still have some value, especially in a microservices environment where several services owned by different teams might be involved in servicing a request. In the words of an engineer I know:</p><blockquote name=\"6818\" id=\"6818\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p\">It\u2019s so nice being in an org that communicates quantitatively about systems.</blockquote><p name=\"3a32\" id=\"3a32\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote\">It seems pragmatic for individual teams to treat services owned by other teams as blackboxes. This enables individual teams to design better integrations with other systems owned by different teams based on the <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">contracts</em> they expose and <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">guarantees</em> they offer\u200a\u2014\u200atheir SLA, in other words.</p><figure name=\"58b9\" id=\"58b9\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Whitebox vs Blackbox monitoring</figcaption></figure><h4 name=\"691b\" id=\"691b\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure\">Whitebox Monitoring versus Observability</h4><p name=\"8d6b\" id=\"8d6b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--h4\">\u201c<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Whitebox </em>monitoring\u201d refers to a category of \u201cmonitoring\u201d based on the information derived from the internals of systems. Whitebox monitoring isn\u2019t really a revolutionary idea anymore. Time series, logs and traces are all more in vogue than ever these days and have been for a few years.</p><p name=\"c5b6\" id=\"c5b6\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">So then. Is Observability just whitebox monitoring by another name?</p><p name=\"c1bb\" id=\"c1bb\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Well, not <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">quite</em>.</p><h4 name=\"3676\" id=\"3676\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">Data and Information</h4><p name=\"f95d\" id=\"f95d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">The difference between whitebox monitoring and observability really is the difference between data and information. The formal definition of information is:</p><blockquote name=\"2a5c\" id=\"2a5c\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong\">Data</strong> are simply facts or figures\u200a\u2014\u200a<em class=\"markup--em markup--blockquote-em\">bits</em> of information, but not information itself.

Information provides context for data.</blockquote><p name=\"0311\" id=\"0311\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote\">The distinction between monitoring and observability isn\u2019t just about if the data is being reported from the bowels of the system or if it\u2019s collected via treating the system as a blackbox. The distinction, in my opinion, is more <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">purpose-driven</em>, than origin-driven. It\u2019s not so much about <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">where</em> this data comes from than <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">what we plan to do with it </em>and how <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">easily</em> we can achieve this<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">.</em></p><p name=\"867d\" id=\"867d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Whitebox monitoring is a fantastic <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">source of</em> <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">data. </em>Observability<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\"> </em>is our ability to <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">easily</em> and <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">quickly</em> find <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">germane information</em> from this data <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">when</em> we need it. Observability is more about <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">what </em>information we might require about the behavior of our system in production and whether we will be able to have access to this information. It doesn\u2019t matter so much if this information is pre-processed or if it\u2019s derived from the data on the fly. It\u2019s also not about <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">how</em> we plan to <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">process</em> and <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">use</em> the raw data.

There\u2019s nothing worse than being blindsided by a problem only to realize we could\u2019ve done better had we had better visibility into it sooner.

We could optimize for <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">some </em>of these or maybe even <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">all </em>of these<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">. </em>Whitebox monitoring is an important component (possibly <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">the </em>most important component) that helps us achieve all of these aforementioned goals, but whitebox monitoring, <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">per se</em>, isn\u2019t observability.</p><figure name=\"f082\" id=\"f082\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Monitoring vs Observability</figcaption></figure><p name=\"32aa\" id=\"32aa\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Different organizations might have different requirements for what falls under \u201cmonitoring\u201d. For some, dependency analysis might be an active part of their \u201cmonitoring\u201d. For others, security auditing might be an indispensable part of their Monitoring goals. As such, I see Observability as a <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">spectrum</em> and something constantly evolving as a service evolves.</p><p name=\"6fb7\" id=\"6fb7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Another way of looking at what falls under \u201cmonitoring\u201d as opposed to what\u2019s \u201cobservability\u201d is by differentiating what we do <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">reactively</em> as opposed to what we do <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">proactively</em>.</p><figure name=\"aae3\" id=\"aae3\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"/><p name=\"9a37\" id=\"9a37\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Again, this might be different for different organizations, but I think it\u2019s important to differentiate between the two purposes. Proactively generating information from data because we feel we might need them at all times is different from generating information on the fly at the time of debugging or analysis from data proactively collected.</p><p name=\"8239\" id=\"8239\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Yet another way of looking at this spectrum is to perhaps distinguish based on the Ops versus Dev responsibilities. I see \u201cmonitoring\u201d as something that requires being on-call. Observability I see as something that <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">mandatorily</em> requires developer/software engineer participation.</p><figure name=\"20ca\" id=\"20ca\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"/><p name=\"1493\" id=\"1493\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Furthermore, it\u2019s worth noting at there\u2019s a cause/effect relationship at play here in the spectrum. A lot of times what people \u201cmonitor\u201d at one layer (metrics like error rate and duration of request) are often the \u201csymptoms\u201d, with the cause being several layers down the spectrum.</p><figure name=\"8614\" id=\"8614\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"/><p name=\"addf\" id=\"addf\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Being able to troubleshoot a problem involves often starting with a symptom reported by a coarse-grained metric (increased error rate or response time) or a trace (service B is slow for certain types of requests from downstream service C) that provides a bird\u2019s eye view of the problem and then iteratively drilling down to corroborate or invalidate our theories thereby reducing the search space at every iteration, until we finally reach the information needed to until we arrive at the root cause.</p><figure name=\"cb0c\" id=\"cb0c\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"/><p name=\"7086\" id=\"7086\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Which brings me to my next point about \u2014</p><h4 name=\"44c3\" id=\"44c3\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">Observability isn\u2019t just about data collection</h4><p name=\"b1b1\" id=\"b1b1\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">While having access to data becomes a requirement if we wish to derive information from it, Observability isn\u2019t just about data collection alone. Once we have the data, it becomes important to be able to get answers/information from this data easily.</p><figure name=\"69d4\" id=\"69d4\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"/><p name=\"559a\" id=\"559a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">While it\u2019s true that raw data is more malleable than pre-processed information, deferring processing of information until we actually need it incurs other overheads, namely that of collection, storage and on-the-fly processing. While it might sound all very well in theory to state that implementation details don\u2019t matter so long as we can get to our Observability goals, how the data that is being gathered can be best processed and stored becomes a key <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">practical consideration</em> if we wish to achieve the dream of establishing and sustaining the virtuous cycle. <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Usability</em> of data becomes a key concern as well, as does the barrier to data collection.</p><p name=\"7775\" id=\"7775\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">And lastly, I\u2019d argue that the most overarching aspect of Observability isn\u2019t data collection or processing. Having data at our disposal alone doesn\u2019t solve problems. Problem solving also involves the right amount of engineering intuition and domain experience to ask the right questions of the data to be able to get to the bottom of it. In fact, good Observability isn\u2019t possible without having good engineering intuition and domain knowledge, even if one had all the tools at one\u2019s disposal. And that really is what the rest of this post aims to address, by hopefully giving you some food for thought in terms of how to build systems to make it possible to gain better insights from them.</p><h4 name=\"adba\" id=\"adba\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">The Three Pillars of Observability</h4><p name=\"de8c\" id=\"de8c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">A more concrete example would help us understand logs, metrics and traces better. Let us assume the architecture of our system or sub-system looks like the following:</p><figure name=\"2883\" id=\"2883\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"/><h4 name=\"8b86\" id=\"8b86\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure\">Logs</h4><p name=\"a49f\" id=\"a49f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">A log is an immutable record of discrete <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">events</em> that happened over time. Some people take the view that <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">events</em> are distinct compared to <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">logs</em>, but I\u2019d argue that for all intents and purposes they can be used interchangeably.</p><p name=\"3bbc\" id=\"3bbc\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Event logs in general come in three forms:</p><p name=\"6953\" id=\"6953\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">1.</strong> <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Plaintext</strong>\u200a\u2014\u200aA log record might take the form of free-form text.

Coming back to the example we saw above, let us assume that all of these various services also emit logs at varying degrees of granularity. Some services might emit more log information per request than others. Looking at logs alone, our data landscape might look like the following:</p><figure name=\"9760\" id=\"9760\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"/><p name=\"c836\" id=\"c836\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">The very first thing that jumps out to me when I look at the above diagram is abundance of <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">data</em> points. Recording anything and everything that might be of interest to us becomes incredibly useful when we are searching at a very fine level of granularity, but simply looking at this mass of data, it\u2019s impossible to infer at a glance what the request lifecycle was or even which systems the request traversed through or even the overall health of any particular system. Sure, the data might be <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">rich</em> but without further processing, it\u2019s pretty <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">impenetrable</em>.</p><p name=\"cfe7\" id=\"cfe7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">What we require, in short, is <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">information</em>. The interesting aspect of <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">information </em>in the context of this discussion is <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">what </em>information we\u2019re looking for? Do we want information about the lifecycle of a request? Or do we want information about the resource utilization of a specific service? Or do we want information about the health of a specific host? Or do we want information about why a specific service crashed? Or do we want information about the replication lag in a distributed key value store? Or are we looking for information about how long it took an eventually consistent system to converge? Or are we looking for information about GC pauses? Or are we trying to glean information about the <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">symptoms </em>or are we trying to find the root <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">cause</em>? There is, quite frankly, an <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">endless </em>amount of data points we can collect and an <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">endless </em>number of questions we can answer, from the most trivial to the most difficult.</p><p name=\"8994\" id=\"8994\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Two very important pieces of information, however, pertains to the <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">fate of requests </em>throughout their lifecycle (which is usually short lived)<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\"> </em>and the <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">fate of a system as a whole </em>(measured over a duration that is orders of magnitudes longer than request lifecycles)<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">. </em>I see both traces and metrics as an <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">abstraction</em> built on top of logs that <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">pre-process</em> and encode information along two orthogonal axes, one being <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">request </em>centric, the other being <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">system </em>centric.</p><figure name=\"d94c\" id=\"d94c\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"/><h4 name=\"af64\" id=\"af64\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure\">Traces</h4><p name=\"b76c\" id=\"b76c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">A trace is a representation of a series of causally-related distributed events that encode the end-to-end request flow through a distributed system. A single trace can provide visibility into both the <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">path</em> traversed by a request as well as the <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">structure</em> of a request. The path of a request allows us to understand the services involved in the servicing of a request, and the <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">structure </em>of a trace helps one understand the junctures and effects of asynchrony in the execution of a request.</p><figure name=\"1c96\" id=\"1c96\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"/><p name=\"1b87\" id=\"1b87\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Albeit discussions around tracing pivot around their utility in a microservices environment, I think it\u2019s fair to suggest that any sufficiently complex application that interacts with\u200a\u2014\u200aor rather, <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">contends</em> for\u200a\u2014\u200aresources such as the network or disk in a non-trivial manner can benefit from the benefits tracing can provide.</p><p name=\"f3c1\" id=\"f3c1\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The basic idea behind tracing is straightforward\u200a\u2014\u200aidentify specific points in an application, proxy, framework, library, middleware and anything else that might lie in the path of execution of a request, instrument these points and have these coordinate with each other. These points are of particular interest since they represent forks in execution flow (OS thread or a green thread) or a hop or a fan out across network or process boundaries that a request might encounter in the course of its lifecycle.</p><p name=\"dff7\" id=\"dff7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Usually represented as a directed acyclic graph, they are used to identify the amount of work done at each layer while preserving causality using <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">happens-before</em> semantics. The way this is achieved is by adding instrumentation to specific points in code. When a request begins, it\u2019s assigned a globally unique ID, which is then propagated throughout the request path, so that each point of instrumentation is able to insert or enrich metadata before passing the ID around to the next hop in the meandering flow of a request. When the execution flow reaches the instrumented point at one of these services, a record is emitted along with metadata. These records are usually asynchronously logged to disk before being submitted out of band to a collector, which then can reconstruct the flow of execution based on different records emitted by different parts of the system.</p><p name=\"877e\" id=\"877e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Collecting this information and reconstructing the flow of execution while preserving causality for retrospective analysis and troubleshooting enables one to understand the lifecycle of a request better. Most importantly, having an understanding of the entire request lifecycle makes it possible to <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">debug requests spanning multiple services</em> to pinpoint the source of increased response time or resource utilization. As such, traces largely help one understand the <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">which </em>and sometimes even the <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">why\u200a\u2014\u200a</em>like <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">which </em>component of a system is even touched during the lifecycle of a request and is slowing the response?</p><h4 name=\"5d9f\" id=\"5d9f\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">Metrics</h4><p name=\"8f05\" id=\"8f05\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">The official definition of metrics is:</p><blockquote name=\"42f1\" id=\"42f1\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p\">a set of numbers that give information about a particular process or activity.</blockquote><p name=\"6991\" id=\"6991\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote\">Metrics are a <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">numeric</em> representation of our data and as such can fully harness the power of mathematical modeling and prediction to derive knowledge of the behavior of our system over intervals of time in the present and future\u2014 in other words, a <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">time series</em>. The official definition of time series\u00a0:</p><blockquote name=\"2db5\" id=\"2db5\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p\">a list of numbers relating to a particular activity, which is recorded at regular periods of time and then studied. Time series are typically used to study, for example, sales, orders, income, etc.</blockquote><p name=\"5c4a\" id=\"5c4a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote\">Metrics are just <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">numbers</em> measured over intervals of time, and numbers are optimized for storage, processing, compression and retrieval. As such, metrics enable longer retention of data as well as easier querying, which can in turn be used to build dashboards to reflect historical trends. Additionally, metrics better allow for gradual reduction of data resolution over time, so that after a certain period of time data can be aggregated into daily or weekly frequency.</p><p name=\"4406\" id=\"4406\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">One of the biggest drawback of historical time series databases has been the <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">identification</em> of metrics which didn\u2019t lend itself very well toward exploratory analysis or filtering. The hierarchical metric model and the lack of tags or labels in systems like Graphite especially hurt in this regard. Modern monitoring systems like Prometheus represent every time series using a metric <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">name</em> as well as additional key-value pairs called <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">labels</em>.</p><figure name=\"4f93\" id=\"4f93\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">The anatomy of a Prometheus metric</figcaption></figure><p name=\"fa4c\" id=\"fa4c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">This allows for a high degree of <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">dimensionality</em> in the data model. A metric is identified using both the metric name and the labels. Metrics in Prometheus are immutable; changing the name of the metric or adding or removing a label will result in a new time series. The actual data stored in the time-series is called a <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">sample </em>and it consists of two components\u200a\u2014\u200aa <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">float64</em> value and a millisecond precision timestamp.</p><h4 name=\"affc\" id=\"affc\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">The pros and cons of each in terms of resource utilization, ease of use, ease of operation, and cost effectiveness</h4><p name=\"f68c\" id=\"f68c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Let\u2019s evaluate each of the three in terms of three criteria before we see how we can leverage the strengths of each to craft a great Observability experience:</p><p name=\"4b72\" id=\"4b72\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">\u2014 Ease of generation/instrumentation<br/>\u200a\u2014\u200aEase of processing\u00a0<br/>\u200a\u2014\u200aEase of querying/searching<br/>\u200a\u2014\u200aQuality of information<br/>\u200a\u2014\u200aCost Effectiveness</p><h4 name=\"aeb3\" id=\"aeb3\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h4-strong\">Logs</strong></h4><p name=\"bde4\" id=\"bde4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Logs are, by far, the easiest to generate since there is no initial processing involved. The fact that it is just a string or a blob of JSON makes it incredibly easy to represent any data we want to emit in the form of a log line. Most languages, application frameworks and libraries come with in built support for logging. Logs are also easy to instrument, since logs are just <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">printfs</code> in production, and adding a log line is quite as trivial as adding a print statement. Logs also perform really well in terms of surfacing highly granular information pregnant with rich <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">local </em>context that can be great for drill down analysis, so long as our search space is <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">localized </em>to a single service.</p><p name=\"f44a\" id=\"f44a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The utility of logs, unfortunately, ends right there. Everything else I\u2019m going to tell you about logs is only going to be painful. While log <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">generation </em>might be easy, the performance idiosyncrasies of various popular logging libraries leave a lot to be desired. Most performant logging libraries allocate very little, if any, and are extremely fast. However, the default logging libraries of many languages and frameworks are not the cream of the crop, which means the application as a whole becomes susceptible to suboptimal performance due to the overhead of logging. Additionally, log messages can also be lost unless one uses a protocol like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliable_Event_Logging_Protocol\" data-href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliable_Event_Logging_Protocol\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">RELP</a> to guarantee reliable delivery of messages. This becomes especially important if one is using log data for billing or payment purposes. Lastly, unless the logging library can dynamically sample logs, logging has the capability to adversely affect application performance as a whole. As someone mentioned on a Slack:</p><blockquote name=\"9e68\" id=\"9e68\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p\">A fun thing I had seen while at [redacted] was that turning off most logging almost doubled performance on the instances we were running on because logs ate through AWS\u2019 EC2 classic\u2019s packet allocations like mad. It was interesting for us to discover that more than 50% of our performance would be lost to trying to control and monitor performance.</blockquote><p name=\"2e39\" id=\"2e39\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote\">On the processing side, raw logs are almost always normalized, filtered and processed by a tool like Logstash, fluentd, Scribe or Heka before they\u2019re persisted in a data store like Elasticsearch or BigQuery. If an application generates a large volume of logs, then the logs might require further buffering in a broker like Kafka before they can be processed by Logstash. Hosted solutions like BigQuery have quotas you cannot exceed. On the storage side, while Elasticsearch might be a fantastic search engine, there\u2019s a real operational cost involved in running it. Even if your organization is staffed with a team of Operations engineers who are experts in operating ELK, there might be other drawbacks. Case in point\u200a\u2014\u200aone of my friends was telling me about how he would often see a sharp downward slope in the graphs in Kibana, not because traffic to the service was dropping but because ELK couldn\u2019t keep up with the indexing of the sheer volume of data being thrown at it. Even if log ingestion processing isn\u2019t an issue with ELK, no one I know of seems to have fully figured out how to use Kibana\u2019s UI, let alone <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">enjoy </em>using it.</p><p name=\"d495\" id=\"d495\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">While there is no dearth of hosted SaaS offerings for log management, they are probably better known for their obscene pricing. The fact that a large number of organizations choose to outsource log management <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">despite </em>the cost is a testament to how operationally hard, expensive and fragile running it in-house is.</p><p name=\"ab14\" id=\"ab14\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">An antidote often proposed to the problem of the cost overhead of logging is to sample or to only log actionable data. But even when sampled aggressively, it requires us to make decisions <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">a priori</em> as to what might be actionable. As such, our ability to log \u201cactionable\u201d data is entirely contingent on our ability to be able to predict what will be actionable or what data might be needed in the future. While it\u2019s true that better understanding of a system might allow us to make an educated guess as to what data now gathered can prove to be a veritable source of information in the future, potentially every line of code is point of failure and as such could become the source of a log line.</p><h4 name=\"577b\" id=\"577b\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">Metrics</h4><p name=\"ff78\" id=\"ff78\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">By and large, the <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">biggest</em> advantage of metrics based monitoring over logs is the fact that unlike log generation and storage, metrics transfer and storage has a constant overhead. Unlike logs, the cost of metrics doesn\u2019t increase in lockstep with user traffic or any other system activity that could result in a sharp uptick in data.</p><p name=\"8ec3\" id=\"8ec3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">What this means is that with metrics, an increase in traffic to an application will not incur a significant increase in disk utilization, processing complexity, speed of visualization and operational costs the way logs do. Metrics <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">storage </em>increases with the number of <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">time series</em> being captured (when more hosts/containers are spun up, or when new services get added or when existing services are instrumented more), but unlike statsd clients that send a UDP packet <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">every time</em> a metric is recorded<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\"> </em>to the statsd daemon (resulting in a <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">directly proportional</em> increase in the number of metrics being submitted to statsd compared to the traffic being reported on!), client libraries of systems like Prometheus aggregate time series samples <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">in-process</em> and submit them to the Prometheus server upon a successful scrape (which happens once every few seconds and can be configured).</p><p name=\"f8d1\" id=\"f8d1\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Metrics, once collected, are also more malleable to mathematical, probabilistic and statistical transformations such as sampling, aggregation, summarization and correlation, which make it better suited to report the overall health of a system.</p><p name=\"3819\" id=\"3819\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Metrics are also better suited to trigger <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">alerts</em>, since running queries against an in-memory time series database is far more efficient, not to mention more reliable, than running a query against a distributed system like ELK and then aggregating the results before deciding if an alert needs to be triggered. Of course, there are systems that strictly query only in-memory structured event data for alerting that might be a little less expensive than ELK, but the operational overhead of running large distributed in-memory databases, even if they were open source, isn\u2019t something worth the trouble for most when there are far easier ways to derive equally actionable alerts. Metrics are akin to blackbox frontends of a system\u2019s performance and as such are best suited to furnish this information.</p><figure name=\"4cc2\" id=\"4cc2\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Metrics as blackbox frontends</figcaption></figure><p name=\"0b0b\" id=\"0b0b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">The biggest drawback with both logs and metrics is that they are <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">system</em> scoped, making it hard to understand anything else other than what\u2019s happening inside of a particular system. Sure, metrics can also be request scoped, but that entails a concomitant increase in label fanout which results in an increase in storage. While the new Prometheus storage engine has been optimized for high churn in time series, it\u2019s also true that metrics aren\u2019t the best suited for highly granular request scoped information. With logs, without fancy joins, a single log line or metric doesn\u2019t give much information about what happened to a request across all components of a system. Together and when used optimally, logs and metrics give us complete omniscience into a <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">silo</em>, but nothing more. While these might be sufficient for understanding the performance and behavior of <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">individual systems\u200a\u2014\u200a</em>both stateful and stateless\u200a\u2014\u200athey come a cropper when it comes to understanding the <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">lifetime </em>of a request that traverses through multiple systems.</p><p name=\"6a2a\" id=\"6a2a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Traces</strong></p><figure name=\"c20f\" id=\"c20f\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"/><p name=\"5220\" id=\"5220\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Tracing captures the lifetime of requests as they flow through the various components of a distributed system. The support for enriching the context that\u2019s being propagated with additional key value pairs makes it possible to encode application specific metadata in the trace, which might give developers more debugging power.</p><p name=\"75bb\" id=\"75bb\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The use cases of distributed tracing are myriad. While used primarily for inter service dependency analysis, distributed profiling and debugging steady-state problems, tracing can also help with chargeback and capacity planning.</p><p name=\"ff4d\" id=\"ff4d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Tracing is, by far, the hardest to retrofit into an existing infrastructure, owing to the fact that for tracing to be truly effective, every component in the path of a request needs to be modified to propagate tracing information. Depending on whom you ask, you\u2019d either be told that gaps in the flow of a request doesn\u2019t outweigh the cons or be told that these gaps are blind spots that make debugging harder.</p><blockquote name=\"bab4\" id=\"bab4\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p\"><a href=\"https://blog.netsil.com/beyond-google-sre-what-is-site-reliability-engineering-like-at-medium-71c65bd35f4e\" data-href=\"https://blog.netsil.com/beyond-google-sre-what-is-site-reliability-engineering-like-at-medium-71c65bd35f4e\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">We\u2019ve been</a> implementing a request tracing service for over a year and it\u2019s not complete yet. The challenge with these type of tools is that, we need to add code around each span to truly understand what\u2019s happening during the lifetime of our requests. The frustrating part is that if the code is not instrumented or header is not carrying the id, that code becomes a risky blind spot for operations.</blockquote><p name=\"be37\" id=\"be37\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote\">The second problem with tracing instrumentation is that it\u2019s not sufficient for developers to instrument <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">their </em>code. A large number of applications in the wild are built using open source frameworks or libraries which might require additional instrumentation. This becomes all the more challenging at places with polyglot architectures, since every language, framework and wire protocol with widely disparate concurrency patterns and guarantees need to cooperate. Indeed, tracing is most successfully deployed in organizations where there are a core set of languages and frameworks used uniformly across the company.</p><p name=\"53fc\" id=\"53fc\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The cost of tracing isn\u2019t quite as catastrophic as that of logging, mainly owing to the fact that traces are almost always sampled heavily to reduce runtime overhead as well as storage costs.

There are a couple of approaches that I think can help alleviate the problem on log generation, processing, storage and analysis.</p><h4 name=\"7fe0\" id=\"7fe0\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">Quotas</h4><p name=\"eb19\" id=\"eb19\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">We either log <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">everything </em>that might be of interest and pay a processing and storage penalty, or we log selectively, knowing that we are sacrificing fidelity but making it possible to still have access to important data. Most talk around logging revolves around log levels, but rarely have I seen quotas imposed on the <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">amount</em> of log data a service can generate. While logstash and friends do have plugins for throttling log ingestion, most of these filters are based on <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">keys </em>and certain thresholds, with throttling happening <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">after the event </em>has been generated.</p><p name=\"62a4\" id=\"62a4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">If logging is provided as an internal service\u200a\u2014\u200aand there are many companies where this is the case\u200a\u2014\u200athen establishing service tiers with quotas and priorities can be a first step. Any user facing request or service gets assigned the highest priority, while infrastructural tasks or background jobs or anything that can tolerate a bounded delay are lower on the priority list.</p><h4 name=\"b23e\" id=\"b23e\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">Dynamic Sampling</h4><p name=\"a527\" id=\"a527\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">With or without quotas, it becomes important to be able to dynamically sample logs, so that the rate of log generation can be adjusted on the fly to ease the burden on the log forwarding, processing and storage systems. In the words of the aforementioned acquaintance who saw a 50% boost by turning off logging on EC2:</p><blockquote name=\"a349\" id=\"a349\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p\">The only thing it kind of convinced me to is the need for the ability to dynamically increase or decrease logging on a per-need basis. But the caveat there is always that if you don\u2019t always run the full blown logging, eventually the system can\u2019t cope to run with it enabled.</blockquote><h4 name=\"13e0\" id=\"13e0\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--blockquote\">Logging is a Stream Processing Problem</h4><p name=\"f80f\" id=\"f80f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Data isn\u2019t only ever used for application performance and debugging use cases. It also forms the source of all analytics data as well. This data is often of tremendous utility from a business intelligence perspective, and usually businesses are willing to pay for both the technology and the personnel required to make sense of this data in order to make better product decisions.</p><p name=\"0fd9\" id=\"0fd9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The interesting aspect to me here is that there are striking similarities between questions a business might want answered and questions we might want answered during debugging. For example, a question that might be of business importance is the following:</p><p name=\"3a26\" id=\"3a26\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">\u2014 Filter to outlier countries from where users viewed this article fewer than 100 times in total.</em></p><p name=\"1eb9\" id=\"1eb9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Whereas, from a debugging perspective, the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/under-the-hood-data-diving-with-scuba/10150599692628920/\" data-href=\"https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/under-the-hood-data-diving-with-scuba/10150599692628920/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">question might look more like</a>:</p><p name=\"68e2\" id=\"68e2\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">\u2014 <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Filter to outlier page loads that performed more than 100 database queries.</em><br/>\u00a0\u2014<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Or, show me only page loads from Indonesia that took more than 10 seconds to load.</em></p><p name=\"b18f\" id=\"b18f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">While these aren\u2019t similar queries from a technical perspective, the infrastructure required to perform these sort of analysis or answer these kinds of queries is largely the same.</p><p name=\"06ef\" id=\"06ef\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">What might of interest to the business might be the fact that:</p><p name=\"900a\" id=\"900a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">\u2014 User A viewed Product X.</p><p name=\"fea5\" id=\"fea5\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Augmenting this data with some extra information might make it ripe for Observability purposes:</p><p name=\"07ec\" id=\"07ec\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">\u2014 User A viewed Product X and the page took 0.5s to load<br/>\u200a\u2014\u200aUser A viewed Product X whose image was not served from cache<br/>\u200a\u2014\u200aUser A viewed Product X and read review Z for which the response time for the API call was 300ms.</p><p name=\"16ca\" id=\"16ca\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Both these queries are made possible by events. Events are essentially structured (optionally typed) key value pairs. Marrying business information along with information about the <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">lifetime</em> of the request (timers, durations and so forth) makes it possible to repurpose analytics tooling for Observability purposes.</p><figure name=\"da1f\" id=\"da1f\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p\"/><p name=\"5da6\" id=\"5da6\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">If you think about this, log processing neatly fits into the bill of Online Analytics Processing (OLAP). Information derived from OLAP systems is not very different compared to information derived for debugging or performance analysis or anomaly detection at the edge of the system. Most analytics pipelines use Kafka as an event bus. Sending enriched event data to Kafka allows one to search in real time over streams with KSQL, <a href=\"https://www.confluent.io/blog/ksql-open-source-streaming-sql-for-apache-kafka/\" data-href=\"https://www.confluent.io/blog/ksql-open-source-streaming-sql-for-apache-kafka/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a streaming SQL engine for Kafka </a>from the fine folks at Confluent.</p><blockquote name=\"2c55\" id=\"2c55\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p\">KSQL supports a wide range of powerful stream processing operations including aggregations, joins, windowing, sessionization, and much more. The Kafka log is the core storage abstraction for streaming data, allowing same data that went into your offline data warehouse is to now be available for stream processing. Everything else is a streaming materialized view over the log, be it various databases, search indexes, or other data serving systems in the company. All data enrichment and ETL needed to create these derived views can now be done in a streaming fashion using KSQL. Monitoring, security, anomaly and threat detection, analytics, and response to failures can be done in real-time versus when it is too late. All this is available for just about anyone to use through a simple and familiar SQL interface to all your Kafka data: KSQL.</blockquote><p name=\"50cf\" id=\"50cf\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote\">Enriching business events that go into Kafka anyway with additional timing and other metadata required for Observability use cases can be helpful when repurposing existing stream processing infrastructures. A further benefit this pattern provides is that this data can be expired from the Kafka log regularly. Most event data required for debugging purposes are only valuable for a relatively short period of time after the event has been generated, unlike any business centric information that normally would\u2019ve been evaluated and persisted by an ETL job. Of course, this makes most sense when Kafka already is an integral part of an organization. Introducing Kafka into a stack purely for real time log analytics is a bit of an overkill, especially in non-JVM shops without any significant JVM operational expertise.</p><h4 name=\"bc2f\" id=\"bc2f\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">A new hope for the\u00a0future</h4><p name=\"8b31\" id=\"8b31\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">The fact that logging still remains an unsolved problem makes me wish for an OpenLogging spec, in the vein of OpenTracing which serves as a shining example and a testament to the power of community driven development. A spec designed ground up for the cloud-native era, blessed by the CNCF, implemented by many backends. A spec that enshrines that logs <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">must be structured events </em>and<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\"> </em>codifies rules around dynamic sampling for high volume, low fidelity events. A spec that can be implemented as libraries in all major languages and supported by all major application frameworks and middleware. A spec that allows us to make the most of advances in stream processing<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">. </em>A spec that becomes the lingua franca logging format of all CNCF projects, especially Kubernetes.</p><h4 name=\"c55c\" id=\"c55c\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">Metrics</h4><blockquote name=\"1f94\" id=\"1f94\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--h4\"><a href=\"https://www.influxdata.com/blog/influxdb-now-supports-prometheus-remote-read-write-natively/\" data-href=\"https://www.influxdata.com/blog/influxdb-now-supports-prometheus-remote-read-write-natively/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Prometheus is much more than just the server.</a> I see Prometheus as a set of standards and projects, with the server being just one part of a much greater whole.</blockquote><p name=\"ed4a\" id=\"ed4a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote\">Prometheus does a great job of codifying the exposition format for metrics, and I\u2019d love to see this become the standard. While Prometheus doesn\u2019t offer long term storage, the remote write feature that was added to Prometheus about a year ago allowed one to write Prometheus metrics to a custom remote storage engine like OpenTSDB or Graphite, effectively turning Prometheus into a write-through cache. With the recent introduction of the generic write backend, one can transport time-series from Prometheus over HTTP and Protobuf to any storage system like Kafka or Cassandra.</p><p name=\"8811\" id=\"8811\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Remote reads, though, is slightly newer and I\u2019ve only been seeing efforts coalesce into something meaningful in the last few months. InfluxDB now natively supports both Prometheus remote reads and writes. Remote reads allows Prometheus to read raw samples from a remote backend during query execution time and compute the results in the Prometheus server.</p><p name=\"899e\" id=\"899e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Furthermore, improvements to the Prometheus storage engine in the upcoming 2.0 release makes Prometheus all the more conducive to cloud-native workloads with vast churn in time-series names. The powerful query language of Prometheus coupled with the ability to define alerts using the same query language and enrich the alerts with templated annotations makes it perfect for all \u201cmonitoring purposes\u201d.</p><p name=\"6fcb\" id=\"6fcb\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">With metrics, however, it\u2019s important to be careful not to explode the label space. Labels should be so chosen so that it remains limited to a small set of attributes that can remain somewhat uniform. It also becomes important to resist the temptation to alert on <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">everything</em>. For alerting to be <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">effective, </em>it becomes salient to be able to identify a small set of hard failure modes of a system. Some believe that the ideal number of signals to be \u201cmonitored\u201d is anywhere between 3\u20135, and definitely no more than 7\u201310. One of the common pain points that keeps cropping up in my conversations with friends is how <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">noisy </em>their \u201cmonitoring\u201d is. Noisy monitoring leads to either metric data that\u2019s never looked at\u200a\u2014\u200awhich in other words is a waste of storage space of the metrics server\u200a\u2014\u200aor worse, false alerts leading to a severe case of alert fatigue.</p><h4 name=\"4de8\" id=\"4de8\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">Traces</h4><p name=\"f744\" id=\"f744\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">While historically tracing has been difficult to implement, the rise of service meshes make integrating tracing functionality almost effortless. Lyft famously got tracing support for all of their applications without changing a single line of code by adopting the service mesh pattern. Service meshes help with the DRYing of observability by implementing tracing and stats collections at the mesh level, which allows one to treat individual services as blackboxes but still get incredible observability onto the <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">mesh </em>as a whole. Even with the caveat that the applications forming the mesh need to be able to forward headers to the next hop in the mesh, this pattern is incredibly useful for retrofitting tracing into existing infrastructures with the least amount of code change.</p><h4 name=\"2abe\" id=\"2abe\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">When it makes sense to augment the three aforementioned tools with additional tools</h4><p name=\"df56\" id=\"df56\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Exception trackers (I think of these as logs++) have come a long way in the last few years and provide a far superior UI than a plaintext file or blobs of JSON to inspect exceptions. Exception trackers also provide full tracebacks, local variables, inputs at every subroutine or method invocation call, frequency of occurrence of the error/exception and other metadata invaluable for debugging. Exception trackers aim to do one thing\u200a\u2014\u200atrack exceptions and application crashes\u200a\u2014\u200aand they tend to do this <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">really</em> well. While they don\u2019t eliminate the need for logs, exception trackers augment logs\u200a\u2014\u200aif you\u2019ll pardon the pun\u200a\u2014\u200a<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">exceptionally</em> well.</p><p name=\"b2ae\" id=\"b2ae\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Some new tools also help achieve visibility by treating the network packets as the source of truth and using packet capture to build the overall service topology. While this definitely has less overhead than instrumenting all application code throughout the stack, it\u2019s primarily useful for analyzing network interactions between different components. While it cannot help with debugging issues with the asynchronous behavior of a multithreaded service or unexpected event loop stalls in a single threaded service, augmenting it with metrics or logs to better understand what\u2019s happening inside a single service can help one gain enough visibility into the entire architecture.</p><h3 name=\"75f3\" id=\"75f3\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Conclusion</h3><p name=\"0e03\" id=\"0e03\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Observability isn\u2019t quite the same as monitoring. Observability connotes something more holistic and encompasses \u201cmonitoring\u201d, application code instrumentation, proactive instrumentation for just-in-time debugging and a culture of more thorough understanding of various components of the system.</p><p name=\"57e9\" id=\"57e9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Observability means having the ability\u200a\u2014\u200aand the confidence\u200a\u2014\u200ato be able to build systems knowing that these systems can turn into a frankensystem in production. It\u2019s about understanding that the software we\u2019re building can be\u200a\u2014\u200aand almost always is\u200a\u2014\u200abroken (or prone to break soon) to varying degrees despite our best efforts. A good analogy between getting code working on one\u2019s laptop or in CI to having code running in production would be the difference between swimming in an indoor pool versus swimming in choppy rivers full of piranhas. The feeling of being unable to fix one\u2019s own service running in a foreign environment for the want to being able to debug isn\u2019t acceptable, not if we want to pride ourselves on our uptime and quality of service.</p><p name=\"814b\" id=\"814b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I want to conclude this post with how I think software development and operation should happen in the time of cloud-native.</p><h4 name=\"52c3\" id=\"52c3\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">Pre-Production Testing</h4><figure name=\"e5cb\" id=\"e5cb\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--h4\"/><p name=\"6410\" id=\"6410\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">It\u2019s important to understand that testing is a best effort verification of the correctness of a system as well as a best effort simulation of failure modes. Unit tests only ever test the behavior of a system against a specified set of inputs. Furthermore, tests are conducted in very controlled (often heavily mocked) environments. While the very few who do fuzz their code benefit from having their code tested against a set of randomly generated input, fuzzing can only comprehensively test against the set of inputs to <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">one</em> service. End-to-end testing might allow for some degree of holistic testing of the system and fault injection/chaos engineering might help us gain a reasonable degree of confidence about our system\u2019s ability to withstand these failures, but <a href=\"http://web.mit.edu/2.75/resources/random/How%20Complex%20Systems%20Fail.pdf\" data-href=\"http://web.mit.edu/2.75/resources/random/How%20Complex%20Systems%20Fail.pdf\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noopener nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">complex systems fail in complex ways</a> and there\u2019s is no testing under the sun that enables one to predict every last vector that could contribute towards a failure.</p><p name=\"254d\" id=\"254d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Despite these shortcomings, testing is as important as ever. If nothing else, testing our code allows us to write better and more maintainable code. More importantly, <a href=\"https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/osdi14/osdi14-paper-yuan.pdf\" data-href=\"https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/osdi14/osdi14-paper-yuan.pdf\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">research</a> has proven that something as simple as \u201ctesting error handling code could have prevented 58% of catastrophic failures<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">\u201d</em> in many distributed systems. The renaissance of tooling aimed to understand the behavior of our services in production does not obviate the need for testing.</p><h4 name=\"b569\" id=\"b569\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">Testing in Production</h4><figure name=\"3fb5\" id=\"3fb5\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--h4\"/><p name=\"b1ad\" id=\"b1ad\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Testing in production <a href=\"https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/seliot/2011/06/07/testing-in-production-tip-it-really-happensexamples-from-facebook-amazon-google-and-microsoft/\" data-href=\"https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/seliot/2011/06/07/testing-in-production-tip-it-really-happensexamples-from-facebook-amazon-google-and-microsoft/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">isn\u2019t really a very new idea</a>. Methodologies such as A/B testing, canary deployments, dark traffic testing (some call this shadowing) have been around for a while.</p><p name=\"3507\" id=\"3507\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Being able to test in production however absolutely requires that the release can be halted and rolled back if the need arises. This in turn means that one can only test in production if one has a quick feedback loop about the behavior of the system one\u2019s testing in production. It also means being on the lookout for changes to key performance indicators of the service. For an HTTP service this could mean attributes like error rate and latencies of key endpoints. For a user facing service, this could additionally mean a change in user engagement. Testing in production essentially means proactively \u201cmonitoring\u201d the change in production. Which brings me to my next point.</p><h4 name=\"606d\" id=\"606d\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">Monitoring</h4><p name=\"eb67\" id=\"eb67\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Monitoring isn\u2019t dead. Monitoring, in fact, is so important that I\u2019d argue it occupies the pride of place in your Observability spectrum.</p><figure name=\"bbd4\" id=\"bbd4\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"/><p name=\"5cc7\" id=\"5cc7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">In order to test in production, one <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">needs </em>good, effective monitoring. Monitoring that is both failure centric (in that we proactively monitor for changes to KPI\u2019s) as well as human centric (we want the developer who pushed out the change to test in production to be alerted as soon as possible).</p><p name=\"c861\" id=\"c861\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I chose to call this Tier I Monitoring, for the want of better word, since I believe these are table stakes. It\u2019s the very minimum <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">any </em>service thats going to be in production needs to have. It\u2019s what alerts are derived from and I believe that time-series metrics are the best suited for this purpose.</p><p name=\"51d0\" id=\"51d0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">However, there are several other bits and pieces of information we might capture but not use for alerting. There\u2019s a school of thought that all such information isn\u2019t of much value and needs to be discarded. I, however, believe that this is the sort of information I often find myself requiring often enough that I want it presented to me in the form of a dashboard.</p><figure name=\"328c\" id=\"328c\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"/><p name=\"4293\" id=\"4293\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">A good example of this sort of tier II monitoring would be <a href=\"http://monitor.gitlab.net/dashboard/db/fleet-overview?refresh=5m&amp;orgId=1\" data-href=\"http://monitor.gitlab.net/dashboard/db/fleet-overview?refresh=5m&amp;orgId=1\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">this dashboard</a> of GitLab\u2019s which is aptly named <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">fleet overview </em>or <a href=\"http://monitor.gitlab.net/dashboard/db/go-processes?refresh=30s&amp;orgId=1\" data-href=\"http://monitor.gitlab.net/dashboard/db/go-processes?refresh=30s&amp;orgId=1\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">this one</a> which gives information about the running Go processes. I picked these examples because GitLab is famously known for their transparency and these are real, live production dashboards of a real company. I find analyzing these dashboards more interesting than cooking up toy examples for the purpose of a blog post.</p><p name=\"0c77\" id=\"0c77\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">While these metrics don\u2019t particularly help with debugging of gremlins or problems we don\u2019t even know exist, having such dashboards gives me a bird\u2019s eye view of the system, which I find invaluable especially after a release, since it gives me extremely quick feedback about how known key metrics might have been impacted by the change, but weren\u2019t severe enough to trigger an alert. Measuring heap usage for a potential memory leak would be a good example of such Tier II monitoring. I would really like to know if I pushed out a code that\u2019s leaking memory, but I don\u2019t consider it something I necessarily want to be <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">alerted </em>on.</p><h4 name=\"30a5\" id=\"30a5\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">Exploration</h4><figure name=\"d352\" id=\"d352\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--h4\"/><p name=\"73f5\" id=\"73f5\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Then there\u2019s exploration, which I find useful to answer questions one could not have proactively thought about. Usually based on the querying of raw events which support massive dimensionality, these are usually extremely powerful for surfacing answers we couldn\u2019t have predicted beforehand.</p><h4 name=\"5466\" id=\"5466\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">Dynamic Exploration</h4><figure name=\"dd8c\" id=\"dd8c\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--h4\"/><p name=\"0bec\" id=\"0bec\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">The problem with all of the three approaches seen until now is that they require that we record information about our systems <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">a priori. </em>What this means is the the data we need is generated before we can derive any useful information from it.</p><p name=\"4320\" id=\"4320\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Dynamic instrumentation techniques aren\u2019t new, but the most famous implementations like DTrace were primarily machine centric and mostly correlate events that remain confined to an address-space or specific machine. However, <a href=\"http://sigops.org/sosp/sosp15/current/2015-Monterey/printable/122-mace.pdf\" data-href=\"http://sigops.org/sosp/sosp15/current/2015-Monterey/printable/122-mace.pdf\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">recent academic research</a> has married these ideas with some of the ideas pioneered by distributed tracing, allowing one to \u201cto obtain an arbitrary metric at one point of the system,while selecting, filtering, and grouping by events meaningful at other parts of the system, even when crossing component or machine boundaries\u201d.</p><p name=\"3200\" id=\"3200\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The primary breakthrough demonstrated this paper proposed is the <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">baggage </em>abstraction.</p><blockquote name=\"cb00\" id=\"cb00\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p\">Baggage is a per-request container for tuples that is propagated alongside a request as it traverses thread, application and machine boundaries. Tuples follow the request\u2019s execution path and therefore explicitly capture the happened-before relationship. Using baggage, Pivot Tracing efficiently evaluates happened-before joins in situ during the execution of a request.</blockquote><p name=\"25ba\" id=\"25ba\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote\">The idea of baggage propagation has been <a href=\"https://github.com/opentracing/specification/blob/master/specification.md#set-a-baggage-item\" data-href=\"https://github.com/opentracing/specification/blob/master/specification.md#set-a-baggage-item\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">incorporated into the OpenTracing </a>spec, which now enables \u201carbitrary application data from a mobile app can make it, transparently, all the way into the depths of a storage system\u201d. While this still isn\u2019t quite the same as what the whitepaper describes, it still gets us one step closer to true end-to-end tracing and the ability to dynamically enrich tracing data for better visibility.</p><h4 name=\"e332\" id=\"e332\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">Unknowables</h4><figure name=\"5866\" id=\"5866\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--h4\"/><p name=\"21d7\" id=\"21d7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">And finally there are the unknowables. Things we can\u2019t know about or don\u2019t need to know about. Even if we have complete omniscience into our application and hardware performance, it\u2019s simply not feasible\u200a\u2014\u200aor required\u200a\u2014\u200ato have complete visibility into the various layers of abstractions underneath the application layer. Think ARP packet losses, BGP announcements or recursive BGP lookups, OSFP states and all manner of other implementation details of abstractions we rely on without a second thought. We simply have to get comfortable with the fact that there are things we possibly cannot know, and that it\u2019s OK.</p><p name=\"64ae\" id=\"64ae\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Which brings me to my final point \u2014</p><h4 name=\"4c0e\" id=\"4c0e\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">Choose your own Observability Adventure</h4><p name=\"8eab\" id=\"8eab\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4 graf--trailing\">Observability\u200a\u2014\u200ain and of itself, and like most other things\u200a\u2014\u200aisn\u2019t particularly useful. The <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">value</em> of the Observability of a system directly stems from the business value we derive from it. For many businesses, having a good alerting strategy and time-series based \u201cmonitoring\u201d is probably all that\u2019s required to be able to deliver on the business goals. For others, being able to debug needle-in-a-haystack type of problems might be what\u2019s needed to generate the most business value. Observability, as such, isn\u2019t an absolute.

In prehistory (and even not too long ago) humans from other tribes were not perceived as belonging to the same species: they don&#x27;t speak my language, their customs are different, they smell different, therefore they are not the same species as me.

That&#x27;s when domestication started: feeding on defenseless cows and goats was a lot safer than feeding on humans armed with spears and axes.

Unfortunately, although Tensorflow has been around for about two years, I still cannot find a bashing of Tensorflow that leaves me fully satisfied.</p>\n\n<p>Although I suppose it\u2019s possible I might be asking the wrong search engine, I think there\u2019s a different force at work here: Google envy.  The phenomenon known as \u201cGoogle deep envy\u201d is the following set of assumptions made by engineers across the world:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>People who work at Google are more intelligent and competent than yourself</li>\n  <li>If you learn Tensorflow you could get a deep learning job at Google! (keep deep dreaming young fellow)</li>\n  <li>If your mediocre startup uses Tensorflow and you blog about its virtues maybe Google will want to buy it</li>\n  <li>If you don\u2019t \u201cget\u201d Tensorflow\u2019s unintuitive design, you\u2019re just dumb</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Let\u2019s leave our assumptions behind us for now and give Tensorflow an honest look.</p>\n\n<p>When Tensorflow first came out, we were promised an end to the endless nightmare of poorly designed or poorly maintained deep learning frameworks. (e.g. <a href=\"https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/issues\">https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/issues</a>).  What we got instead, was the deep learning framework equivalent of Java (write once, run everywhere), but less fun to work with, and with a purely declarative paradigm.  Yuck.</p>\n\n<p>Where did things go wrong? In trying to build a tool to satisfy everyone\u2019s needs, it seems that Google built a product that does a so-so job of satisfying anyone\u2019s needs.</p>\n\n<p>For researchers, Tensorflow is hard to learn and hard to use.  Research is all about flexibility, and lack of flexibility is baked into Tensorflow at a deep level.</p>\n\n<p>Want to extract the values of intermediate layers of a neural net? You\u2019ll need to define a graph, and then execute it with the data passed in as a dictionary, and oh don\u2019t forget to add the intermediate layers as outputs of the graph, or else you won\u2019t be able to retrieve their values.  Ok, that hurt, but it\u2019s doable.</p>\n\n<p>Want to execute layers conditionally, such as an RNN that stops whenever an end-of-sentence (EOS) token is produced? Someone using Pytorch will be on their 3rd failed AI startup by the time you\u2019re done with that.</p>\n\n<p>For machine learning practitioners such as myself, Tensorflow is not a great choice either.  The declarative nature of the framework makes debugging much more difficult.  The advantage of being able to run models on Android or iOS looks great until you see how big the framework binaries are (20MB+), or you try to look at the nearly non-existent C++ documentation, or you want to do any kind of conditional network execution, which is super useful in low resource situations such as mobile.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"comparisons-with-other-frameworks\">Comparisons with other frameworks</h1>\n<p>It is true that the developers of Tensorflow are deep learning superstars.  However, the original developer of Tensorflow that is probably most widely known and respected, Yangquing Jia, has recently left Google to join Facebook, where his Caffe2 project is quietly picking up steam: (<a href=\"https://github.com/caffe2/caffe2/graphs/contributors\">https://github.com/caffe2/caffe2/graphs/contributors</a>,  <a href=\"https://github.com/caffe2/caffe2/issues\">https://github.com/caffe2/caffe2/issues</a>).  Unlike Tensorflow, Caffe2 allows the user to execute a layer on a piece of data in one line of code.  Radical!</p>\n\n<p>In addition, Pytorch is quickly developing popularity amongst top AI researchers.  Torch users, although nursing RSI injuries from writing Lua code to perform simple string operations, simply aren\u2019t deserting in droves to Tensorflow \u2013 they are switching to Pytorch.  It appears that Tensorflow is just not good enough for top AI labs.  Sorry, Google.</p>\n\n<p>The most interesting question to me is why Google chose a purely declarative paradigm for Tensorflow in spite of the obvious downsides of this approach.  Did they feel that encapsulating all the computation in a single computation graph would simplify executing models on their TPU\u2019s so they can cut Nvidia out of the millions of dollars to be made from cloud hosting of deep learning powered applications? It\u2019s difficult to say.  Overall, Tensorflow does not feel like a pure open source project for the common good.  Which I would have no problem with, had their design been sound.  In comparison with beautiful Google open source projects out there such as Protobuf, Golang, and Kubernetes, Tensorflow falls dramatically short.</p>\n\n<p>While declarative paradigms are great for UI programming, there are many reasons why it is a problematic choice for deep learning.</p>\n\n<p>Take the React Javascript library as an example, the standard choice today for interactive web applications.  In React, the complexity of how data flows through the application makes sense to be hidden from the developer, since Javascript execution is generally orders of magnitudes faster than updates to the DOM.  React developers don\u2019t want to worry about the mechanics of how state is propagated, so long as the end user experience is \u201cgood enough\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, in deep learning, a single layer can literally execute billions of FLOP\u2019s! And deep learning researchers care very much about the mechanics of how computation is done and want fine control because they are constantly pushing the edge of what\u2019s possible (e.g. dynamic networks) and want easy access to intermediate results.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"a-concrete-example\">A concrete example</h1>\n\n<p>Let\u2019s look at a simple example of training a model to multiply its input

In the statement announcing the launch of its eyewear division, Kering highlighted that, \"The premium segment of the eyewear business is currently growing in the high double-digits.\"</p>\n<p>The importance of eyewear as an entry-level product for its brands speaks to the other key advantage stemming from Kering\u2019s move: control. The Exane BNP Paribas report states, \u201cThe ubiquitous distribution typical of most license contracts adds to brand trivialisation risk.\u201d By taking its eyewear in-house, controlling development, distribution and sales, Kering could \u201cmaintain desirability through perceived exclusivity.\u201d</p>\n<p>What's more, Kering is now free to work with multiple manufacturing partners \u2014 including the Safilo Group \u2014 on a case-by-case basis. This freedom will allow the company to build out each of its eleven brands\u2019 eyewear businesses in a way that is carefully tailored to the consumer profile and DNA of each brand.</p>\n<p><strong>A Question of Scale</strong></p>\n<p>The scale of Kering\u2019s eyewear business is significantly smaller than that of Luxottica and Safilo. \u201cThe major challenge in eyewear is to serve a very fragmented customer base \u2014 reaching it with sales and logistics is expensive and demands local scale. Building scale is important for Kering as it will operate at a commercial and distribution cost disadvantage versus Safilo,\u201d says Luca Solca, head of luxury goods at Exane BNP Paribas.</p>\n<p>Kering is not the first luxury group to bring its eyewear business in-house. In 1999, Prada ceased licensing its brand to Luxottica and formed its own eyewear company, Eyewear International Distribution S.A, in partnership with De Rigo. The venture was short-lived. When Prada ended its dealings with De Rigo in 2002, to return to Luxottica, the joint venture company's\u00a0sales stood at $33.6 million. At the time, Luxottica said in a statement that it expected Prada\u2019s eyewear sales to jump to $120 million in its first year back with the company: clear evidence of the power of Luxottica\u2019s distribution network.</p>\n<p>Indeed, although Kering has a global network of stores (respectively, <span id=\"658\"><a href=\"http://www.businessoffashion.com/community/companies/gucci\" bof-track=\"\" class=\"kws_link imp clk profile_id_658\" data-e=\"profile.link\" data-id=\"658\" profile-popover=\"\" title=\"Gucci\" subtitle=\"Firenze, Italy\" img=\"uploads/media/header_image/0001/12/53469d8823eb8221083f8bee94b1195a34c6c58a.jpeg\" content=\"Founded in Florence in 1921, Gucci is one of the world\u2019s  leading luxury fashion brands, with a renowned reputation for creativity\">Gucci</a></span> and <span id=\"794\"><a href=\"http://www.businessoffashion.com/community/companies/saint-laurent\" bof-track=\"\" class=\"kws_link imp clk profile_id_794\" data-e=\"profile.link\" data-id=\"794\" profile-popover=\"\" title=\"Saint Laurent\" subtitle=\"Paris, France\" img=\"uploads/media/bof_company_logo/0002/61/fe34cee86591f50f5057759f9c3803e048a6904f.jpeg\" content=\"Synonymous to youth and freedom, Yves Saint Laurent was the first couture house to introduce the concept of luxury pr\u00eat-\u00e0-porter\">Saint Laurent</a></span> had 408 and 91 monobrand points of sale in 2014, according to statistics compiled by Exane BNP Paribas), it pales in significance compared to the own-retail network of Luxottica. In the unlikely event that Luxottica, the largest eyewear retailer in the world, stopped buying Kering eyewear, Kering would lose key distribution points, especially outside of its own stores in\u00a0North America. Furthermore, Kering would have to develop\u00a0wholesale relationships with local eyewear retailers to achieve full reach: most small regional towns have an optician \u2014 few, however, have a Gucci store.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you're coming in new and you're trying to leverage a brand, I think you have a very long way to go. It's very difficult to build a solution, work-wise, when your three largest competitors could block you out of parts of the market,\u201d said Claudio Gottardi, chief executive of Marchon. \u201cThe question is: What could a new entrant into the market offer that will allow that company to enter the market without a return for the people who they are going to be competing [with],\u201d he continued.</p>\n<p><strong>A Growing Global Market</strong></p>\n<p>\u201cThe market, structurally, globally, is really growing,\u201d said Luisa Delgado, chief executive of the Safilo Group. \u201cOn one side, it\u2019s driven by demographics: the development of certain markets where an increasing middle class is getting access to interesting brands. But then there's also education, an ageing population: it [all] stimulates the growth of our industry,\u201d she continued, highlighting how higher rates of education and longer life expectancy are increasing the demand for prescription glasses.</p>\n<p>To capitalise on this growth, the eyewear market\u2019s biggest players have expanded internationally \u2014 and continue to do so. \u201cIn 2009 I started opening sister companies across the globe,\u201d said Marchon\u2019s Gottardi. \u201cI went directly to China, Singapore, Portugal, Scandinavia, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and all of the [Arabian] Gulf. Just to give you an idea, in Brazil, our revenues are about six times higher than four years ago.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExpansion into market areas, especially in emerging markets, has been the biggest driver of our growth over the last five years,\u201d said Massimo Vian, co-chief executive of Luxottica. Indeed, Luxottica\u2019s Q1 2015 results for Asia-Pacific and Latin America reported growth of 18.7 percent and 21.7 percent, respectively. Luxottica is also treating North America as an emerging market, in terms of potential for further penetration.</p>\n<p>And then there is the digital opportunity. Due to the product's\u00a0small size and one-size-fits-all model,\u00a0eyewear is well-suited to digital retail, creating further\u00a0opportunity for growth. \u201cWe have been active as a company over the last three years, with the Glasses.com acquisition [in January 2014] and the new Ray-Ban [digital sales] platform,\u201d said Vian. Tapping into the current consumer trend for customisation, the platform allows consumers to choose any combination of lens, frame style and colour. \u201cThat service has been growing 100 percent year-on-year, starting from a relatively low base and small numbers, but it is developed enough to understand the potential of that channel,\u201d Vian continued.</p>\n<p>Clearly, new markets, emerging consumer demographics and new product streams are driving growth across the eyewear market. These drivers are particularly germane\u00a0to the premium fashion segment \u2014 a fact Kering is well aware of. As an established player in the eyewear market, Kering has powerful, pre-existing relationships between its brands and global consumers, but it will need to operationalise this in a market with additional distribution channels in order to compete with the incumbents.</p>\n</div>\n</div></body></html>"}, "15429067": {"score": 148, "comments": ["See extensive discussion on HN (1054 points, 406 comments) of this issue back in May.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=14287235\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=14287235</a>", "Thank you; I looked up that post\u2019s title on HN before posting it but got no result.", "I am the author of the Wikipedia essay &quot;Wikipedia has Cancer&quot;.

For those readers who were around three years ago, did you notice at the time any unmet needs that would have caused you to conclude that the WMF needed to increase spending by $30 million dollars? I certainly didn't.</p>\n<p>From 2005 to 2015, annual inflation in the US was between 1% and 3% per year, and cumulative inflation for the entire decade was 21.4%\u2014far less than the increase in WMF spending. We are even <a href=\"/wiki/Metastasis\" title=\"Metastasis\">metastasizing</a> the cancer by bankrolling local chapters, rewarding them for finding new ways to spend money.<sup id=\"cite_ref-18\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-18\">[18]</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-19\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-19\">[19]</a></sup></p>\n<p>Nothing can grow forever. Sooner or later, something is going to happen that causes the donations to decline instead of increase. It could be a scandal (real or perceived). It could be the WMF taking a political position that offends many donors. Or it could be a recession, leaving people with less money to give. It might even be a lawsuit that forces the WMF to pay out a judgement that is larger than the reserve. Whatever the reason is, it <i>will</i> happen. It would be na\u00efve to think that the WMF, which up to this point has never seriously considered any sort of spending limits, will suddenly discover fiscal prudence when the revenues start to decline. It is far more likely that the WMF will not react to a drop in donations by decreasing spending, but instead will ramp up fund-raising efforts while burning through our reserves and our endowment.</p>\n<p>Although this essay focuses on spending, not fundraising, it could be argued that the ever-increasing spending is a direct cause of the kind of fund-raising that has generated a storm of criticism.<sup id=\"cite_ref-20\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-20\">[20]</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-21\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-21\">[21]</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-22\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-22\">[22]</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-23\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-23\">[23]</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-24\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-24\">[24]</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-25\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-25\">[25]</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-26\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-26\">[26]</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-27\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-27\">[27]</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-28\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-28\">[28]</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-29\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-29\">[29]</a></sup> These complaints have been around for years,<sup id=\"cite_ref-30\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-30\">[30]</a></sup> leading one member of a major Wikimedia mailing list to automate his yearly complaint about the dishonesty he sees every year in our fundraising banners.<sup id=\"cite_ref-31\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-31\">[31]</a></sup></p>\n<p>No organization can sustain this sort of spending on a long-term basis. We should have leveled off our spending years ago. Like cancer, WMF spending is growing at an exponential rate. Like cancer, this will kill the patient unless the growth is stopped. Some charities can safely grow without limits. If you are feeding 1,000 starving orphans per week, a ten times increase in revenue means that you will be able to feed 10,000 orphans per week. Wikipedia isn't like that. It costs a certain amount to have reliable severs, run a good legal team, maintain the core software, etc. But none of the things that the WMF needs to do require ever-expanding spending.</p>\n<p>The reason I have so little faith in the WMF's ability to adapt to declining revenues (note that I specified the WMF; I think <i>Wikipedia</i> has shown an excellent ability to adapt to multiple problems) is the horrific track record they have regarding adapting to other kinds of problems.</p>\n<p>In particular, their poor handling of software development has been well known for many years. The answer to the WMF's problems with software development has been well known for decades and is extensively documented in books such as <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month\" title=\"The Mythical Man-Month\">The Mythical Man-Month</a></i> and <i><a href=\"/wiki/Peopleware:_Productive_Projects_and_Teams\" title=\"Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams\">Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams</a></i>, yet I have never seen any evidence that the WMF has been following standard software engineering principles that were well-known when <i>Mythical Man-Month</i> was first published in 1975. If they had, we would be seeing things like requirements documents and schedules with measurable milestones. This failure is almost certainly a systemic problem directly caused by top management, not by the developers doing the actual work.</p>\n<p>This is not to imply that decades-old software development methods are somehow superior to modern ones, but rather that the WMF is violating basic principles that are common to both. Nothing about Agile or SCRUM means that the developers do not have to talk to end users, create requirements, or meet milestones. In fact, modern software development methods require <i>more</i> communication and interaction with the final end users. Take as an example the way Visual Editor was developed. There are many pages of documentation on the WMF servers and mailing lists, but no evidence that any developer had any serious discussions with the actual editors of Wikipedia who would be using the software. Instead. the role of \"customer\" was played by paid WMF staffers who thought that they knew what Wikipedia editors need better than the editors themselves do. Then they threw the result over the wall, and the community of Wikipedia editors largely rejected it. Or Knowledge Engine, which was developed in secret before being cancelled when word got out about what the WMF was planning. Another example: The MediaWiki edit toolbar ended up being used by a whopping 0.03% of active editors.<sup id=\"cite_ref-32\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-32\">[32]</a></sup></p>\n<p>After we burn through our reserves, it seems likely that the next step for the WMF will be going into debt to support continued runaway spending, followed by bankruptcy. At that point there are several large corporations (Google and Facebook come to mind) that will be more than happy to pay off the debts, take over the encyclopedia, fire the WMF staff, and start running Wikipedia as a profit-making platform. There are a lot of ways to monetize Wikipedia, all undesirable. The new owners could sell banner advertising, allow uneditable \"sponsored articles\" for those willing to pay for the privilege, or even sell information about editors and users.</p>\n<p>If we want to avoid disaster, we need to start shrinking the cancer now, before it is too late. We should make spending transparent, publish a detailed account of what the money is being spent on and answer any reasonable questions asking for more details. We should limit spending increases to no more than inflation plus some percentage (adjusted for any increases in page views), build up our endowment, and structure the endowment so that the WMF cannot legally dip into the principal when times get bad.</p>\n<p>If we do these things now, in a few short years we could be in a position to do everything we are doing now, while living off of the endowment interest, and would have no need for further fundraising. Or we could keep fundraising, using the donations to do many new and useful things, knowing that whatever we do there is a guaranteed income stream from the endowment that will keep the servers running indefinitely.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a

I know this because for my entire life people have been unable to spell it, even when I spell it for them, and I nearly always do. I went to Disneyland with my parents and we visited a booth selling framed copies of family crests, thinking it would be a fun thing to hang on the wall. Sholes was in the book, but the booth operator could not find it in the computer to print. He told us he\u2019d never seen that happen in 10 years. Long story short\u200a\u2014\u200athere aren\u2019t many Sholeses in the world.</p><p name=\"7ee5\" id=\"7ee5\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">A couple of years back I\u2019d been told by my father that one of our distant ancestors invented the QWERTY keyboard for the typewriter. It was a cool tidbit, but I didn\u2019t think much more about it. Then, last year, I read a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mwichary/status/791709895083102209?lang=en\" data-href=\"https://twitter.com/mwichary/status/791709895083102209?lang=en\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">viral tweet</a> from a guy who\u2019d run across an odd little museum in Spain. I told my friend who lives in Barcelona that next time I was in town we had to check it out\u200a\u2014\u200ahe agreed.</p><p name=\"1049\" id=\"1049\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The <a href=\"http://www.mte.cat/\" data-href=\"http://www.mte.cat/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Museu de la T\u00e8cnica de l\u2019Empord\u00e0</a> is down a side street off the main square in Figueres. We strolled over there after visiting the Dali museum, the common tourist attraction in the city. We\u2019d called a day ahead of time to make sure someone would be there\u200a\u2014\u200athe museum website said it was open only 3 hours a day, so I wanted to be sure. Walking in, we saw an assortment of curiosities, from original Vespas to an 1800s automobile to old gas pumps. Two typewriters sat on the main display by the door. We paid the older gentleman at the desk our 3 Euro and he told us to go to the third floor for the \u2018tour\u2019.</p><p name=\"bf75\" id=\"bf75\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The two of us rode up in a small elevator, and it opened out into the scene we\u2019d read about. Typewriters everywhere. Rooms full of them. We were immediately greeted by the proprietress Margarita, who was giving a tour to a Spanish family. My friend translated for me, because she did not speak any English. She took us through the origin story of the typewriter, from its early days through the 20th century.</p><figure name=\"a3f2\" id=\"a3f2\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Original Sholes &amp; Glidden, circa\u00a01874</figcaption></figure><p name=\"3bb7\" id=\"3bb7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">When we reached the first Sholes prototype at the museum, Margarita explained how it worked\u200a\u2014\u200ait was foot powered and the paper was propelled along the top of the machine with dual rollers, while the arms swung from beneath into the ink roll. This model was built prior to functional refinements by the Remington company, which led to the creation of the modern typewriter with the Sholes keyboard. Early Sholes &amp; Glidden machines were beautifully painted to appeal to a better class of customer, since the price tag was high for the day.</p><figure name=\"7a62\" id=\"7a62\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"/><p name=\"ecc9\" id=\"ecc9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">After she explained the history of the machine on display, I stopped her to show her my driver\u2019s license, explaining that I was a Sholes. Margarita lit up, and immediately held out her hand to me. She told me (via my friend\u2019s translation) that she would show me books after the tour about my ancestor, and the story of his inventions. It was an emotional moment, hearing this from someone who had dedicated her life to collecting these machines.</p><p name=\"ac85\" id=\"ac85\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The museum is incredible\u200a\u2014\u200anot only for the size of the collection, but because you can touch most of the models. Perhaps two-thirds of the typewriters on display were not behind glass. Margarita demonstrated how some of the more esoteric machines worked\u200a\u2014\u200aChinese typewriters, music typewriters, single-press typewriters with swing arms to peck out individual letters. She told the story of an old machine they found at a flea market that, when it was cleaned up, turned out to be a typewriter Mussolini had commissioned to give as a gift and was thought lost forever in the War.</p><figure name=\"a012\" id=\"a012\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\"><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">\u201cMussolini\u201d typewriter, made of solid\u00a0bronze</figcaption></figure><p name=\"eb37\" id=\"eb37\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">We made our way down to the second floor full of sewing machines. Margarita told us the history of the sewing machine, from hand-crank devices to the invention of the foot pedal and on through the development of electric motors and battery power. They had hundreds on display, some of them ornately painted and some very clearly designed with function in mind. The sewing machine was an important part of any houeshold in the 19th and 20th century, and the museum\u2019s collection had a huge variety. Singer was the brand most represented, but they also had boutique machines from French and Spanish manufacturers, as well as commercial devices intended to mass produce clothing. They had a device designed to repair pantyhose, which at the time were too expensive to replace often.</p><p name=\"bc8c\" id=\"bc8c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The ground floor housed many of the random curiosities the couple had come across during their years of collecting. There was an original Edison Dictaphone along with the shaving machine to \u201cerase\u201d the wax cylinders it inscribed.</p><figure name=\"7738\" id=\"7738\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"/><p name=\"bf35\" id=\"bf35\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">The tour was now over, and she introduced us to her husband Pere, the other proprietor of the museum. He walks with a crutch and no longer does tours himself. The origin story of the collection was that the couple owned a transportation company and Pere was\u200a\u2014\u200ain her words\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cvery busy\u201d with work until one day he decided to purchase and fix up an old typewriter from a flea market. He was hooked. Since their business took them all over Europe, they began to collect the machines and store them in warehouses they owned in Spain. Over years the collection expanded to fill the museum. Incredibly, Margarita said they had over <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">thirty-five hundred </em>typewriters in storage that were not on display, along with many other items they did not have the room for.</p><p name=\"35ae\" id=\"35ae\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">As we marveled at the collection Margarita brought out books to show me, in English, that told the story of my ancestor, Latham-Sholes. My friend spoke with the couple in Spanish, learning about their lives as I read. We left reluctantly, after going back upstairs to take photos of all the typewriters. They had turned some of the lights out, so I was unable to get photos of the sewing machine floor\u200a\u2014\u200aI felt it rude to inconvenience them any further. The experience was a bit overwhelming\u200a\u2014\u200athe museum contains so many machines from so many different origins I find it hard to recount all of it now, even after a guided tour.</p><p name=\"ac5f\" id=\"ac5f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">As I read about my ancestor the narrative of his challenges and the process of his invention emerged. I could relate. As a young entrepreneur, I faced many of the hurdles he did\u200a\u2014\u200adoubters, repeated failures, bad business partners. In the end he did not become rich\u200a\u2014\u200ahe sold his portion of the patent to Remington for somewhere between six and twelve thousand dollars. He wasn\u2019t particularly well-known for his invention, though his name did feature on a number of machines over the next few decades. The Latham-Sholes contribution to history was the refinement of the typewriter keyboard; his became the optimal layout for keys to avoid the arms jamming during typing. Touching some of his original creations from a hundred and forty years ago, actually <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">typing</em> on a Sholes from the 1800s, was an incredible way to connect with an ancestor. The machines he made <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">still work</em>. His flash of genius solved a small problem in his time, and his legacy is now on billions of electronic devices around the world. I got a window into my past, and I clacked away on it to my heart\u2019s content.</p><figure name=\"acf3\" id=\"acf3\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">A Sholes, typing on a\u00a0Sholes</figcaption></figure><p name=\"7995\" id=\"7995\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">I took a lot of other photos after the tour of the varied and bizarre machines on display.

I&#x27;m mostly curious about any possible &quot;inter-op&quot; issues with GnuPG and U2F functionality (for example, I have heard reports that gpg-agent would &quot;reset&quot; after a U2F auth and so would require a PIN on next use regardless of any timeouts; that&#x27;s not a problem for me, just something I&#x27;d like to be aware of beforehand). Thanks!", "Be prepared to pull and replace the Yubikey when switching between applets. I currently use a key configured with U2F, gpg (and ssh via gpg-agent), and oath totp. Usually it switches between applets seamlessly, requiring pin entry for gpg any time I switch back to gpg.<p>Occasionally whichever applet I&#x27;m attempting to use will appear unavailable, requiring the token be pulled and reseated.", "Yeah, I&#x27;ve heard similar reports before and that&#x27;s exactly the kind of thing I was wanting to hear about because, e.g., the Nano can be a PITA to remove sometimes -- especially on my workstation, where it is plugged into one of the USB ports on the &quot;back&quot; of a Das Keyboard. I don&#x27;t mind punching in my PIN all the time (I already use short timeouts anyways), but removing and reinserting the Nano several times a day is inconvenient and will get annoying real quick.<p>Thanks.", "I used to run into this regularly as well, usually with gpg-agent refusing to work. I recently switched to a 4C Nano, which made it quite cumbersome to pull the key, so I looked into it and found out that reloading gpg-agent does the trick as well. I use this alias to do that quickly:<p><pre><code>    alias gpgpls=&#x27;gpg-connect-agent reloadagent &#x2F;bye&#x27;\n</code></pre>\nI haven&#x27;t needed to pull the key since. I&#x27;m on macOS and use gpg-agent, U2F and yubioath-desktop.", "Oh, excellent, that&#x27;s great to know. I run Arch Linux on these particular machines but, in this case, it probably doesn&#x27;t matter. Thank you.", "If people are going to leave the USB device in all the time, why not just use the onboard TPM the machine probably already has? At least on Windows, the TPM can create a virtual smart card so existing infrastructure can just use that as normal.<p>Then you get keys protected by hardware. Though the TPMs might commonly be easier to physically hack than good USB devices.", "For U2F, there are two issues. First, communication doesn&#x27;t use a smart card protocol, it uses a custom protocol over USB&#x2F;HID. So to implement U2F using the TPM you would need to write a virtual USB device driver, which is a pain. Github wrote one for Mac, but there&#x27;s nothing for Linux or Windows to my knowledge. Second, U2F calls for a physical presence check. With most existing hardware, there&#x27;s no way for the TPM to verify physical presence, so it has to be done in the client software, which reduces the point somewhat. Newer hardware may address the second point, as I&#x27;ve seen some new laptops with TPMs hooked up to the fingerprint reader.<p>For other smartcard-y things: a lot of stuff gets called a &quot;smart card&quot;, but any given application is going to involve a particular applet on a smartcard, and a particular client side implementation to use it. The Windows virtual smart card implements a PIV applet, I believe, whereas most of the Yubico stuff works using either non-standard applets or a PGP smartcard applet. So the client side would not be compatible with the Windows virtual smartcard.", "I&#x27;d be very interested to see the author review how the cryptocurrency hardware wallets Ledger[0] and Trezor[1] compare - they also have U2F functionality.

The same goes for wired solutions with hardware USB peripherals (though atleast significantly less complex).  Being sure the hardware peripheral doesn&#x27;t have any major memory safety issues is a complete bear to test, and that&#x27;s not even touching on sidechannel analysis.<p>* Running public key crypto on microcontroller (excluding specific hardware crypto support) is a little more novel than a desktop machine, the leading libraries are no where near as extensively battle tested. And there&#x27;s architectural concerns about sidechannel attacks and often the lack of any memory protection units (bigger chips solve these issues, but power budget concerns are tricky).<p>* And given all software has bugs, how do you update the firmware? Signed firmware patches as part of driver update?

Each possible transport (i.e. USB, NFC, or Bluetooth) has its own spec for how to encapsulate the U2F messages over that transport (e.g. <a href=\"https://fidoalliance.org/specs/fido-u2f-v1.2-ps-20170411/fido-u2f-hid-protocol-v1.2-ps-20170411.html\">here's the USB one</a>). FIDO is working on much more complex (and more capable) second versions of these specs, but currently all security keys implement the basic ones.</p>\n\n<p>In essence, the U2F spec only contains three functions: Register, Authenticate, and Check. Register creates a new key-pair. Authenticate signs with an existing key-pair, after the user confirms physical presence, and Check confirms whether or not a key-pair is known to a security key.</p>\n\n<p>In more detail, Register takes a 32-byte challenge and a 32-byte appID. These are intended to be SHA-256 hashes, but are opaque and can be anything. The challenge acts as a nonce, while the appID is bound to the resulting key and represents the context of the key. For web browsers, the appID is the hash of a URL in the origin of the login page.</p>\n\n<p>Register returns a P-256 public key, an opaque key handle, the security key's batch certificate, and a signature, by the public key in the certificate, of the challenge, appID, key handle, and public key. Since the security keys are small devices with limited storage, it's universally the case in the ones that I've looked at that the key handle is actually an encrypted private key, i.e. the token offloads storage of private keys. However, in theory, the key handle could just be an integer that indexes storage within the token.</p>\n\n<p>Authenticate takes a challenge, an appID, and a key handle, verifies that the appID matches the value given to Register, and returns a signature, from the public key associated with that key handle, over the challenge and appID.</p>\n\n<p>Check takes a key handle and an appID and returns a positive result if the key handle came from this security key and the appID matches.</p>\n\n<p>Given that, there are a number of properties that should hold. Some of the most critical:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>The key handle should be encrypted; i.e. we shouldn't be able to find an ECDSA private key in there.</li>\n\t<li>A key handle from one security key should not work with another, even of the same type.</li>\n\t<li>If a security key is asked to generate hundreds of key-pairs, they should all be distinct.</li>\n\t<li>All the signatures should have unique nonces, otherwise you have the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm#Security\">PlayStation bug</a> and can extract private keys.</li>\n\t<li>The appID should actually be checked.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>But there are a number of other things that would be nice to test:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Does the key handle have patterns? Ideally it would be indistinguishable from random to outside observers.</li>\n\t<li>Is the key handle mutable? Really the whole thing should be authenticated.</li>\n\t<li>Are the signatures correctly encoded? It's a very simple structure, but it's ASN.1 so there are corner-cases.</li>\n\t<li>The USB protocol transmits 64-byte packets, the padding bytes at the end should all be zero, not random bits of memory.

acquired one of these since the round-up of security keys that I did <a href=\"/2017/08/13/securitykeys.html\">last time</a> so I'll give a full introduction here. (See also <a href=\"https://github.com/hillbrad/U2FReviews#secureclick\">Brad's review</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>This is a Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) token, which means that it works with both Android and iOS devices. For non-mobile devices, it includes a USB-A BLE dongle. The SecureClick uses a Chrome extension for configuring and pairing the dongle, which works across platforms. The dongle appears as a normal USB device until it sees a BLE signal from the token, at which point it \u201cdisconnects\u201d and reconnects as a different device for actually doing the U2F operation. Once an operation that requires user-presence (i.e. a Register or Authenticate) has completed, the token powers down and the dongle disconnects and reconnects as the original USB device again.</p>\n\n<p>If you're using Linux and you configure udev to grant access to the vendor ID &amp; product ID of the token as it appears normally, nothing will work because the vendor ID and product ID are different when it's active. The Chrome extension will get very confused about this.</p>\n\n<p>However, once I'd figured that out, everything else worked well. The problem, as is inherent with BLE devices, is that the token needs a battery that will run out eventually. (It takes a CR2012 and can be replaced.) VASCO claims that it can be used 10 times a day for two years, which seems plausible. I did run the battery out during testing, but testing involves a lot of operations. Like the Yubico, I did not find any problems with this token.</p>\n\n<p>I did have it working with iOS, but it didn't work when I tried to check the battery level just now, and I'm not sure what changed. (Perhaps iOS 11?)</p>\n\n<p><b>Feitian ePass</b></p>\n\n<p>ASN.1 DER is designed to be a \u201cdistinguished\u201d encoding, i.e. there should be a unique serialisation for a given value and all other representations are invalid. As such, numbers are supposed to be encoded minimally, with no leading zeros (unless necessary to make a number positive). Feitian doesn't get that right with this security key: numbers that start with 9 leading zero bits have an invalid zero byte at the beginning. Presumably, numbers starting with 17 zero bits have two invalid zero bytes at the beginning and so on, but I wasn't able to press the button enough times to get such an example. Thus something like one in 256 signatures produced by this security key are invalid.</p>\n\n<p>Also, the final eight bytes of the key handle seem to be superfluous: you can change them to whatever value you like and the security key doesn't care. That is not immediately a problem, but it does beg the question: if they're not being used, what are they?</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, the padding data in USB packets isn't zeroed. However, it's obviously just the previous contents of the transmit buffer, so there's nothing sensitive getting leaked.</p>\n\n<p><b>Thetis</b></p>\n\n<p>With this device, I can't test things like key handle mutability and whether the appID is being checked because of some odd behaviour. The response to the first Check is invalid, according to the spec: it returns status 0x9000 (\u201cNO_ERROR\u201d), when it should be 0x6985 or 0x6a80. After that, it starts rejecting all key handles (even valid ones) with 0x6a80 until it's unplugged and reinserted.</p>\n\n<p>This device has the same non-minimal signature encoding issue as the Feitian ePass. Also, if you click too fast, this security key gets upset and rejects a few requests with status 0x6ffe.</p>\n\n<p>USB padding bytes aren't zeroed, but appear to be parts of the request message and thus nothing interesting.</p>\n\n<p><b>U2F Zero</b></p>\n\n<p>A 1KiB ping message crashes this device (i.e. it stops responding to USB messages and needs to be unplugged and reinserted). Testing a corrupted key handle also crashes it and thus I wasn't able to run many tests.</p>\n\n<p><b>KEY-ID / HyperFIDO</b></p>\n\n<p>The Key-ID (and HyperFIDO devices, which have the same firmware, I think) have the same non-minimal encoding issue as the Feitian ePass, but also have a second ASN.1 flaw. In ASN.1 DER, if the most-significant bit of a number is set, that number is negative. If it's not supposed to be negative, then a zero pad byte is needed. I think what happened here is that, when testing the most-significant bit, the security key checks whether the first byte is &gt; 0x80, but it should be checking whether it's &gt;= 0x80. The upshot is the sometimes it produces signatures that contain negative numbers and are thus invalid.</p>\n\n<p>USB padding bytes aren't zeroed, and include data that was not part of the request or response. It's unlikely to be material, but it does beg the question of where it comes from.</p>\n\n<p>The wrapped keys also have some unfortunate properties. Firstly, bytes 16 through 31 are a function of the device and the appID, thus a given site can passively identify the same token when used by different accounts. Bytes 48 through 79 are unauthenticated and, when altered, everything still works except the signatures are wrong. That suggests that these bytes are the encrypted private key (or the encrypted seed to generate it). It's not obvious that there's any vulnerability from being able to tweak the private key like this, but all bytes of the key handle should be authenticated as a matter of best practice. Lastly, bytes 32 through 47 can't be arbitrarily manipulated, but can be substituted with the same bytes from a different key handle, which causes the signatures to be incorrect. I don't know what's going on there.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, the key handle structure is sufficiently far from the obvious construction to cause worry, but not an obvious vulnerability.</p>\n\n    </div>\n

computer science and social media. It is computational propaganda. Computational propaganda is the use of computer information systems for political purposes according to the journal <a href=\"http://comprop.oii.ox.ac.uk/2017/01/17/call-for-papers-special-issue-on-computational-propaganda-and-political-big-data/\">Big Data</a>. This would also include the efforts of governments to influence public opinion of another country in order to change the foreign relations and policy of that country or to cause dissent of citizens against their government.</p>\n<h2 id=\"countering-propaganda\">Countering Propaganda</h2>\n<p>The first step and most important to take is to realize that propaganda is real. And then to admit that propaganda does impact the thought process of citizens. So I will start with the first step of describing computational propaganda and then ways to computationally identify it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"elements-of-computational-propaganda\">Elements of Computational Propaganda</h2>\n<p>There are various elements to computational propaganda that I will attempt to outline. Some of the elements include: algorithms, automation, human curation <a href=\"http://comprop.oii.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/89/2017/06/Casestudies-ExecutiveSummary.pdf\">source</a>, artificial intelligence, social media bots, sock puppets, troll farms, cyber attacks and stolen information, disinformation and data science.</p>\n<p>This new generation of propaganda has gone through a process of computerized automation. It is not totally automated but computers, networks and the internet have made it possible to deliver it in an automated manner. It is also enabling the delivery in a personal manner, in a way that makes it seem to be coming from a real human. Technology is also making strides in the automatic production of propaganda.</p>\n<p>Previously propaganda was slower moving and required getting news and editorials published. One used to have to own or control media outlets and then put people in place to spread disinformation. Our new modern way of spreading information online with social media has lowered the cost of spreading propaganda.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-propaganda?\">What is propaganda?</h2>\n<p>Propaganda is not just pure lies and conspiracy theories. It has come a long way from the Nazi and the communist USSR mode of operation that might obvious to us now. Current propaganda is infused with truth although it is also either partly true or out of context in hidden ways to individual audiences. This information can now be tailored and targeted at individuals. Often this information is geared to lead people to action as all good propaganda should.</p>\n<p>Jacques Ellul in <em>Propaganda The formation of Men\u2019s Attitudes</em> says that it is difficult to determine what propaganda is because it is a \u201csecret action\u201d. Ellul finds it impossible to pin down an exact definition of propaganda that did not take up an entire book. Our society has propaganda baked in that we are not aware of. In short, propaganda for Ellul covered the following areas:</p>\n<ul id=\"draft_check_box_list_0\">\n<li>Psychological Action \u2013 seeks to modify opinions by pure psychological methods</li>\n<li>Psychological Warfare \u2013 destroy the morale of an adversary so that the opponent begins to doubt the validity of his beliefs and actions</li>\n<li>Brainwashing \u2013 only used on prisoners to turn enemies to allies</li>\n<li>Public and Human Relations \u2013 These group activities are also propaganda as they seek to adapt a person to a society. As we will see foreign governments use this technique in social media today.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ellul says: \u201cmodern propaganda is based on scientific analysis of psychology and sociology\u2026 the propagandist builds his techniques on the basis of his knowledge of man\u201d Then the effects of the propaganda are measured for results and refined.</p>\n<p>These thoughts written in 1956 have only continued to be refined. They are now at work on the internet and in social media. And now there is a faster way to measure the results with computers and tracking of online activity.</p>\n<p>In reality, there are competing propaganda efforts happening online. There is a democratic propaganda that competes with anti-democratic strains and militant islamic ones also.</p>\n<h2 id=\"computational-propaganda-in-action\">Computational Propaganda in Action</h2>\n<p>But to take a step back I want to outline what this looks like online at the moment as I understand it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2016\">2016</h3>\n<p>Computational propaganda burst onto the awareness of the public during the 2016 US presidential election and continues today. This effort by Russian actors over many years and I will outline some of the features that are computational in nature. The entire propaganda system is co-dependant but attempts to hide as disconnected entities.</p>\n<p>Recently it has been reported that Russian based accounts on Facebook and Twitter have been spreading propaganda to divide the American public. They used <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2017/09/27/media/facebook-black-lives-matter-targeting/index.html\">Facebook</a> to support both sides of the Black Lives Matter protests, promote gun rights and anti-immigration. This has also been observed on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/27/trump-russia-investigation-reddit\">Reddit</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/27/technology/twitter-russia-election.html\">Twitter</a>. Some accounts were bots or semi-automated bots and other accounts were used to purchase targeted advertisements.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cyber-war\">Cyber War</h3>\n<p>One element was stealing information through cyber attacks and social engineering. This exhibited itself in the taking of information from the Democratic National Convention and utilizing classified leaks given to WikiLeaks.</p>\n<p>Personal information on American citizens by foreign intelligence services has been stolen. Security questionnaires were taken by Chinese services. And recently credit information was appropriated in addition to voter rolls from an unknown number of states during the elections. This personal information is <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-jared-kushner-russia-hacking-20170712-story.html\">alleged</a> to have enabled the more precise targeting of propaganda to specific populations.</p>\n<h3 id=\"propganda-generation\">Propaganda Generation</h3>\n<p>Then this information was selectively transformed into propaganda by taking it out of context and targeting it at select audiences. I can assume that producers of the propaganda used computer software to search the massive amounts of information that was stolen. Then they edited the most damaging of the information to refine it for maximum effect on specific audiences.</p>\n<h3 id=\"targeting-propaganda\">Targeting Propaganda</h3>\n<p>This was also the case for the efforts of the Trump campaign where they took comments damaging to an opponent and targeted voter suppression ads at specific <a href=\"https://medium.com/startup-grind/how-the-trump-campaign-built-an-identity-database-and-used-facebook-ads-to-win-the-election-4ff7d24269ac\">people</a>. Social media ad networks and databases were used in these efforts. These systems allow anyone to target a message at thousands of different personal identifiers, location and income brackets. This can be done on Facebook and Twitter.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/efficiency-you-14407157\"><img src=\"https://c10.patreonusercontent.com/3/eyJwIjoxfQ%3D%3D/patreon-media/post/14407157/6d777fb07d394c018ca37d0684d71370?token-time=1507766400&amp;token-hash=JZUHdeDdSKpRORcXCW0kPlVt5Dfrk8RD2SPloPq1w_o%3D\" alt=\"Targeting Ad on Facebook\"/></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Targeting Ad on Facebook</p></div>\n<p>The advertisement above is being targeted at people in NY City who engage with liberal political content and have a net worth between 1 million and 2 million.</p>\n<h3 id=\"personal-propaganda\">Personal Propaganda</h3>\n<p>In addition there are stores of personal data that was correlated with computational algorithms to determine specific personality traits of individuals. Using this information messaging was crafted and target it at psychological vulnerabilities of individuals to change their thinking or push them to action. <a href=\"https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/mg9vvn/how-our-likes-helped-trump-win\">source</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"the-troll-factory\">The Troll Factory</h3>\n<p>On top of this paid targeting there are places called troll factories where armies of people engage in social interactions on social media and blogs. There is one of these in St. Petersburg called <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/07/magazine/the-agency.html\">The Factory</a>. People will engage with online content to discredit it with propaganda techniques such as \u201cwhataboutism\u201d. This is where people contest valid facts by pointing out a perceived hypocrisy on the other side of the issue. They will also attempt to generate fake news to cause panic in a particular community.</p>\n<h3 id=\"bots-and-sock-puppets\">Bots and Sock Puppets</h3>\n<p>These efforts combine with a computational technique of online bots, trolls and sock puppets. Sock puppets are online fake personas. They appear to be real people online often appearing as Americans but they just broadcast propaganda.</p>\n<p>Bots are pieces of software that perform online tasks. They may just pickup other people\u2019s messages on line and rebroadcast them. Other bots are more human like and engage in conversations. They often search for keywords in conversations and generate a \u201cwhatboutism\u201d or some disparaging message to confuse readers. There are other bots that are semi-automated. Once these are challenged as being bots or have a question they cannot respond to, a human will intervene and manually provide responses.</p>\n<h3 id=\"bot-networks\">Bot networks</h3>\n<p>These bots and sock puppet accounts often work as a team. They will gang up on conversations and re-broadcast each others messages. The goal is to make their message seem mainstream by its volume or popularity. They can confuse rational conversations and arguments online by misdirecting them and triggering emotional responses.</p>\n<h3 id=\"suppression-of-speech-bots\">Suppression of Speech Bots</h3>\n<p>Recently bots have been suppressing messaging from people who are attempting to get out messages to counter disinformation. In the case of <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/08/twitter-bots-use-likes-rts-for-intimidation/\">Brian Krebs</a> who was attacking the messaging of bots that support Putin they tricked Twitter into disabling Brians account. They did this by causing thousands of accounts to follow him and then retweet his tweets in mass. This effort caused Twitter to automatically assume that Brian was paying bots to promote his account. So they turned it off.</p>\n<h3 id=\"artifical-intelligence\">Artificial Intelligence</h3>\n<p>Artificial intelligence and machine learning are additional computation techniques being weaponized in this information battle. Not only is AI used to automate bots to appear human but it also can to create messaging content. Artificial intelligence processes source documents or training data. Then programmers configure the system to output new messages. It multiplies the efforts of a human to generate new content. This output is then curated or even tested out online. This validates the effectiveness of the content. This feedback loop is used to create more effective triggers for people.</p>\n<h3 id=\"attacking-the-disenfranchised\">Attacking the Disenfranchised</h3>\n<p>Often these efforts to trigger action leverage marginalized groups in society. The bots and troll factories can take domestic content and amplify it for their own purposes. It has been shown that Russian based bots often rebroadcast messages that attempt to increase divisions in US citizens. <a href=\"http://dashboard.securingdemocracy.org/\">Hamilton68</a> illustrates these efforts.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/UCKWHa1.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2017-09-16 at 10.43.50 AM.png\"/><br/>\nThis is a dashboard that tracks known Russian bots and exposes what they are promoting. Often this is anything that breeds mistrust in the US government and pits groups against each other.</p>\n<p>Some countries also invest in traditional media like newspapers,radio and television stations to broadcast messages. They attempt to make this look like real news but it is actually disinformation and propaganda. This \u201cnews\u201d is picked up as legitimate by other news outlets and rebroadcast. People who buy into the messaging with use the source as proof of their opinions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"conspiracy-theories\">Conspiracy Theories</h3>\n<p>Propagandists often use current running conspiracy theories to oppose competing messages or true news. They neutralize the opposition by coming up with a secret conspiracy or amplifying one in circulation.</p>\n<h3 id=\"live-events\">Live events</h3>\n<p>Recently <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/exclusive-russia-used-facebook-events-to-organize-anti-immigrant-rallies-on-us-soil\">The DailyBeast</a> reported that Russian operatives organized and promoted rallies on Facebook. This illustrates the purpose of propaganda which is to move people to action. Once they are acting on the beliefs pushed by the propaganda it can tip into political action.</p>\n<h2 id=\"politics\">Politics</h2>\n<p>At the moment in the US propaganda from Russia seems aimed at changing the foreign policy of the US government. The Russians have secured the information space of their citizens in an authoritarian way that is not acceptable in American society. And they have leveraged the lack of privacy controls in the American capitalist system, where information about people is sold for marketing purposes. It seems that Russian propaganda efforts are only aimed at the destruction of democracy or western values according to <a href=\"http://www.theage.com.au/world/as-facebook-disclosure-shows-russian-influence-campaigns-seek-to-divide-cripple-democracy-20170907-gycgdt.html\">Chris Zappone of The Age</a></p>\n<h1 id=\"computational-countermeasures\">Computational Countermeasures</h1>\n<p>There are hundreds of ideas on how to counter this online propaganda. Some are government policies, industry self policing and educational programs. But I want to focus on countermeasures that are computational. In effect an attempt to fight fire with fire.</p>\n<h2 id=\"innoculation\">Inoculation</h2>\n<p>One way to minimize the impact of propaganda is to have tools that alert an individual of the event. Another type of computational tool is one that allows a community to monitor what others in their community are being targeted with. This can prevent individual weaknesses from being exploited. There are efforts underway in this space but there are opportunities for continual improvement.</p>\n<h3 id=\"current-concepts\">Current concepts</h3>\n\n<h3 id=\"ideas-from-volume\">Ideas from Volume</h3>\n<ul id=\"draft_check_box_list_2\">\n<li>A dark advertisement exposure network. Volunteers install browser agents to gather ads and put them in a public searchable database with the targeting criteria. Could also use fake personas to collect advertisements.</li>\n<li>Public searchable databases of bots and sock puppets identified by computational techniques, such as time of day analysis, linguistic patterns and rebroadcasting behaviours.</li>\n<li>The bot collection database would also hold the relationships between accounts, messages and motives.</li>\n<li>Computational methods software package to identify bots that pretend to be human and out them as bots on the social media</li>\n<li>Browser plug-in that will show a user the motives of a bot and expose a network of bots that link or help each other.

How can citizens and journalists keep up with researching and debunking half truths, obvious lies and nonsense?</p>\n<p>Perhaps we need to build counter bot networks. Of course, ones that fit into the social media companies terms of service.</p>\n<h2 id=\"bot-combat\">Bot Combat</h2>\n<h4>(more ideas from Volume Integration)</h4>\n<ul id=\"draft_check_box_list_3\">\n<li>Bots that disrupt bot networks by sending trigger words to them and keep them busy and away from meaningful conversations.</li>\n<li>Bots that look for disinformation and hoaxes and broadcast information to debunk it</li>\n<li>Artificial intelligence social bots that can automatically research messaging from propaganda bots and counter the messaging</li>\n<li>Crafting fact checking messaging to target back at organizations running troll factories and bot networks</li>\n<li>A force of vetted volunteers that could perform analysis tasks to find bots and propagandists and then write counter arguments to them</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"analysis\">Analysis</h2>\n<p>Of course this rests on the concept of analysis so we would need tools to visualize the data and perform the human effort needed to find relationships and motives of the actors. Some of this effort would be utilizing the many algorithms already designed to detect bots and online propaganda. In addition Volume Integration has a tool that can help monitor and alert on social media account activity and messaging.

This is to give an idea of what to expect in terms\nof cost and profit from a \u00e2\u0080\u009cDIY-to-market\u00e2\u0080\u009d kind of project like this.</p>\n\n<p>For those unfamiliar, <a href=\"https://github.com/conorpp/u2f-zero\">U2F Zero</a> is an\nopen-source secure USB device used for two factor authentication.  I made it\nback in 2016 and did a <a href=\"https://conorpp.com/designing-and-producing-2fa-tokens-to-sell-on-amazon\">semi-large PCB-A run and sold them on\nAmazon</a>.</p>\n\n<p>At the time, I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really know what to expect.  Were people actually going\nto buy these?  Was I going to get bad reviews?  Was someone going to find some\nsecurity bug in the implementation (open-source)?  Is the profit worth the effort?\nNow I can answer all of these questions.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"starting-out\">Starting out</h1>\n\n<p>I started on U2F Zero because I wanted to work on something interesting and\nlearn how to make a PCB.  Here was my first one.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/images/pcbs/r1-front-dirty.jpg.small.jpg\" alt=\"first PCB\"/></p>\n\n<p>It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s poorly laid out.  The traces don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t give a crap about EMF.  And what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a\nground plane?</p>\n\n<p>Eventually, I got better at it.  The project even got an awesome <a href=\"https://github.com/conorpp/u2f-zero/pull/37\">pull\nrequest</a> from <a href=\"https://github.com/cpavlina\">Chris\nPavlina</a>, who is better at layout than I am.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"business-plan\">Business plan</h1>\n\n<p>Eventually, I got the U2F Zero \u00e2\u0080\u009cminimum viable product,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and it was ready to\nhit the market.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/images/u2f-zero-2/proshot.jpg\" alt=\"\"/></p>\n\n<p>I basically guessed that the market would sustain 1000/units per year.  So I\nput in an order of 1100 units to a Chinese PCBA fab\n(<a href=\"https://www.pcbcart.com/\">PCBCart</a>) totaling about $4,000.  The cost is made up of the PCB (~$0.22/unit), the assembly (~$0.44/unit) and the components\n(~$2.26/unit).  All the costs scale with quantity.  Had I ordered 3000 units, I\nwould have saved about $0.35 for each U2F Zero.  But the last thing you want is\n2000 U2F Zeros that no one is buying sitting in a warehouse somewhere\ncollecting Amazon storage fees.</p>\n\n<p>I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to deal with sales and distribution.  I was in the middle of grad\nschool and didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the time or the interest.  So after manufacturing the\ntokens, I shipped them to Amazon to be fulfilled.  This\ndoes come with a cost, of about $1.02-$2.02 in fees per U2F Token sold by Amazon.</p>\n\n<p>After manufacturing and distribution was handled, it was time to execute my\nelaborate market entry plan: write a blog post and post it to Hacker News and\nTwitter.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"sales\">Sales</h1>\n\n<p>I spent almost a whole weekend drafting my <a href=\"https://conorpp.com/designing-and-producing-2fa-tokens-to-sell-on-amazon\">U2F Zero\npost</a>.\nI posted it\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 and it worked.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/images/u2f-zero-2/2016_sales.png\" alt=\"\"/></p>\n\n<p>For the first month, the time between the Amazon shipment and the blog post, there\nwere almost no sales.  Then after the post, there was a spike of <em>207 sales</em>\nover the following week.  Then it balanced out to about 6-7 units per day.  And\n4 months later, they sold out.</p>\n\n<p>There was even an increase in sales around Christmas time.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/images/u2f-zero-2/reviews.png\" alt=\"\"/></p>\n\n<p>And people left mostly good reviews.  I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sure if people\nwould leave good reviews since it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just a cheap token with no case.  But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nvery clear from the listing what it is.  So most people will know what\nthey are purchasing \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and as long as it does a good job fulfilling that image\n\u00e2\u0080\u0093 it has the potential for good reviews.  I think that was an important\ntakeaway.</p>\n\n<p>I did get some negative feedback.  Some customers didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like that Firefox didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t support\nU2F at the time or that the token didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come with instructions.</p>\n\n<p>There was one <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2T5OCAPAFMO2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewpnt\">technical review that tore U2F Zero to\npieces</a>.\nAmongst the issues the reviewer found, there was privacy issue in my\nimplementation.  Not a critical security flaw, but something that would allow\neach U2F Zero to be uniquely identified when it is used.  It was my mistake and\nthere was roughly 1000 units out there with it.  I ended up fixing it and am\noffering replacements for those that purchased an old token.</p>\n\n<p>The reviewer kindly took to opening issues on Github and even updated his\nreview after the firmware issues were fixed.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"profits\">Profits</h1>\n\n<p>As mentioned previously, each token cost about $3.00 to make.  But when\naccounting for the cost of prototyping, packaging, labeling, import taxes,\ntools, and holding 100 units in stock, the unit cost is really about $4.18.\nThere was about $2.02 in fees from Amazon.  The listing price was $8.00.  So\nthat works out to be roughly $2k in profit over 4 months which is about a 42%\nROI.  Not a drop-out-of school kind of haul by any means, but it was a great\nexperience for me and I hope to make similar ventures in the future.</p>\n\n<p>For those interested, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll list the various costs here.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>PCBs: $351.10</li>\n  <li>Assembly + components: $3,062.85</li>\n  <li>Shipping: $59.72</li>\n  <li>Tariffs (from China to U.S.): $126.32</li>\n  <li>Labels: $13.98</li>\n  <li>Polybags: $63.25</li>\n  <li>Tools: $164.94</li>\n  <li>Prototyping: ~$350.00</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1 id=\"other-opportunities-and-events\">Other opportunities and events</h1>\n\n<p>There were some cool unexpected things that happened as a result of U2F Zero.\nA lot of awesome people reached out or shared how they made their own U2F Zero(s) or\npurchased them on Amazon.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/images/u2f-zero-2/twitter.png\" alt=\"\"/></p>\n\n<p>One of which was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/land0ngreer\">Landon\nGreer</a>, who helped organize an infosec conference\nand made custom U2F Zeros as a conference badge.\nLater, the <a href=\"https://cryptovillage.org/\">Crypto &amp; Privacy Village</a> at Defcon\nforked the U2F Zero design and included it in their unofficial 2016 defcon\nbadge.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/images/u2f-zero-2/acpe.jpg\" alt=\"\"/></p>\n\n<p>More recently, the Association for Computers Professionals in Education (ACPE)\nmade a custom order for 400 units and invited me to come spend some time in\nOregon and speak at their conference.  I really enjoyed it.  It was great to\nlearn about a different field and meet new people.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"u2f-zero-round-2\">U2F Zero, round 2</h1>\n\n<p>A few months after selling out, I decided to do another run.  This time I added\nsome improvements to the PCB layout and fix issues in the firmware.  I also\ndecided to order 3000 this time (saved that $0.35 per unit) and support markets\nin <a href=\"https://www.amazon.ca/U2F-Zero/dp/B01L9DUPK6\">Canada</a>, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B01L9DUPK6\">U.K.</a>, and <a href=\"https://u2fzero.ch/products/u2f-zero-1/\">Europe</a>.  I think the U2F standard is\npicking up in popularity so the U2F demand shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go away.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m curious to\nsee how U2F Zero sales differ between different countries.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/images/u2f-zero-2/box.jpg\" alt=\"\"/></p>\n\n<p>At the time of this writing, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve sent 1500 units to the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/U2F-Zero/dp/B01L9DUPK6\">U.S.\nmarketplace</a>, 300 to\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.ca/U2F-Zero/dp/B01L9DUPK6\">Canada</a>, 300 to the\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B01L9DUPK6\">U.K.</a>, and 100 to a <a href=\"https://u2fzero.ch/products/u2f-zero-1/\">distributor in\nSwitzerland</a> that will handle shipments to other countries in Europe.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve kept\nthe rest in storage so I can replenish a marketplace easily if inventory gets\nlow.</p>\n\n<p>U2F Zero has been back on the U.S. market for about 4 months now, after being\nout of stock for about 6 months.  Sales slowly picked back up and average\nabout 5 units per day currently.</p>\n\n<p>My goal is to keep the supply up with minimal effort and not have anymore\ngaping out-of-stock periods.  In the meantime, I can work on the next project.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"thanks\">Thanks!</h1>\n\n<p>Thank you to everyone that has taken an interest in U2F Zero and to those that\nhave contributed to the open source project so far:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you to everyone that supported U2F Zero and made this possible.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve\nlearned a lot since first making this crappy first prototype and will have more\nprojects to launch later.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/images/u2f-zero-2/early_proto.jpg\" alt=\"\"/></p>\n\n<h4>\nHave any questions or comments?  <a href=\"/contact\" target=\"_blank\">Contact me</a> or comment below!\n</h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/_conorpp\" class=\"twitter-follow-button\" data-show-count=\"false\">Follow @_conorpp</a>\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?screen_name=_conorpp\" class=\"twitter-mention-button\" data-show-count=\"false\">Tweet to @_conorpp</a></p>\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n</div></body></html>"}, "15429329": {"score": 2, "comments": [], "time": "2017-10-08 21:33:09", "url": "https://icowatchlist.com/blog/icos-profitable-investments-future-mark-cuban/", "text": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content clearfix\">\n\t\t<p><a href=\"https://icowatchlist.com/blog/mark-cuban-backs-20m-cryptocurrency-start/\">Mark Cuban</a> has said that he sees Bitcoin and its underlying Blockchain or Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) as the way into the future.</p>\n<p>The American tech billionaire and investor countered claims by certain quarters that digital currencies are not real.

Like most other kids my age, I was taking my first&#13;\ncautious steps out of the realm of comics and young adult literature into the world of large words&#13;\nand small print.  My guide and mentor was my friend John MacMaster, fellow inmate at St. Francis Xavier&#13;\nJunior High in Halifax, Nova Scotia.  It was the Fall of 1975, and I was eleven years old.&#13;\n</p><p>&#13;\n</p><table align=\"left\" border=\"0\">&#13;\n<tr><td>&#13;\n<a href=\"../gif/9807/pr14-2.jpg\"><img src=\"../gif/9807/pr14.jpg\" hspace=\"8\" border=\"0\"/></a>&#13;\n<br clear=\"all\"/>&#13;\n<center><font size=\"1\"><i>Art by Gray Morrow</i></font></center>&#13;\n</td></tr>&#13;\n</table>&#13;\nJohn was into some pretty weird stuff in 1975.  For one thing, there was this book he kept waving at me&#13;\ncalled <b>Dune</b>.  The cover had a bunch of <i>Lawrence of Arabia</i> types standing around on rocks and&#13;\nsand, looking boring.  I passed.  John also bought his very own albums, which I thought was pretty funky,&#13;\nand he sat me down to listen to a composition titled \"Welcome to the Machine\" by an outfit called <i>Pink Floyd</i>.&#13;\nIt was... okay.  Although why they couldn't afford to record in a studio without all that talking and banging&#13;\ncoming through the walls was beyond me.&#13;\n<p>&#13;\nJohn also gave me short stories to read by some guy named <i>Harlan Ellison</i> -- who used bad words.&#13;\nHe dragged me outdoors in the middle of a Nova Scotia winter to look at stars in his telescope.  And&#13;\non Halloween he pulled me six blocks to an apartment building he knew where the superintendent dumped all his&#13;\ngoods in the first half hour... only to end up with two bags full of apples.  All in all,&#13;\nJohn was a swell guy, but it was obvious the stuff he was into was far too bent to ever catch on.&#13;\n&#13;\n</p><p>&#13;\nBut I hit paydirt when he loaned me a tattered copy of <b><i>Perry Rhodan #17</i>: The Venus Trap</b>.&#13;\n</p><p>&#13;\n<b>The Venus Trap</b>, by <i>Kurt Mahr</i> (Ace, 1972), didn't have a lot of boring gentlemen on the cover.&#13;\nIt had dinosaurs.  And spacesuits.  And a guy with a raygun.  Now this was more like it.&#13;\n</p><p>&#13;\n</p>&#13;\nAlthough I didn't know it at the time, <b>The Venus Trap</b> borrowed fairly liberally from some of the&#13;\ntruly canonical works of SF -- including <i>Otis Adelbert Kline</i>'s <b><i>Grandson of Terra</i></b> series,&#13;\n<i>Ralph Milne Farley</i>'s tales of <i><b>Spaceman Miles Cabot</b></i>, and of course the Venus series&#13;\nof <i>Edgar Rice Burroughs</i> (also his <b><i>Mars</i></b> series, and a handful of his <b><i>Tarzan</i></b> books, but it was doubtless&#13;\na package deal).  But everything it borrowed, it returned in spades.&#13;\n<p>&#13;\nYou see, by 1975 science fiction that predicted life on Venus -- especially big-lizards-with-pointy-fangs life,&#13;\nor toothy vegetation that mimicked the steamy jungles of the Amazon -- had gone the way of the dinosaurs itself.&#13;\nBy the late 50s, the surface of Venus was known to be an atmospheric boiler room, an environment where even&#13;\nhardened space probes got all sweaty and quickly packed it in.  And when that long-held romantic notion of old&#13;\nschool SF passed away, the pulp adventure tale succumbed soon after.&#13;\n</p><p>&#13;\nIn 1961, the German language version of <b><i>Perry Rhodan</i></b> almost single-handedly began to breathe&#13;\nnew life into the moribund pulp genre.  By the time the ever-energetic <i>Forrest J. Ackerman</i> and his editor&#13;\n<i>Frederik Pohl</i> introduced an English language version in North America eight years later, Rhodan had enjoyed&#13;\nover 400 installments and attained a weekly circulation of 130,000.  Literally hundreds of fan clubs existed,&#13;\nat least one feature film had been made, and total sales were approaching 70 million copies.  <b><i>Perry&#13;\nRhodan</i></b> was a phenomenon -- and in issue number 14, <b>Venus in Danger</b>, it brought its beloved companion,&#13;\nthe Venus romance, back from the cryogenic freeze as well.&#13;\n&#13;\n</p><p>&#13;\n</p><table align=\"right\" border=\"0\">&#13;\n<tr><td>&#13;\n<a href=\"../gif/9807/pr94-2.jpg\"><img src=\"../gif/9807/pr94.jpg\" hspace=\"8\" border=\"0\"/></a>&#13;\n<br clear=\"all\"/>&#13;\n<center><font size=\"1\"><i>Art by Gray Morrow</i></font></center>&#13;\n</td></tr>&#13;\n</table>&#13;\nIt did it with obvious sleight of hand -- by suggesting that the true surface of Earth's sister planet had been&#13;\ndeliberately screened from prying eyes with some kind of projector thingie, a galactic-budget special effect --&#13;\nbut it hardly mattered.  Fans of the SF pulp adventure genre saw the wink and the smiles behind the curtain,&#13;\nand knew that they were in the hands of a team of writers who knew and cherished the fond conventions of old,&#13;\nbut whose canvas and ambitions were far larger.  The Venus romance was by no means the last classic pulp trope&#13;\nresurrected as a stage property for the sprawling cast of <b><i>Perry Rhodan</i></b>, but it was certainly one of the first&#13;\nto signal to North American readers the ride they were in for.&#13;\n<p>&#13;\nNot that I picked up on any of this in 1975.  For me, it was merely a rip-roaring adventure tale, the first of its kind&#13;\nthat I'd ever encountered, and it grabbed me in a way that few books had before (or since).  I lost track of&#13;\nprecisely how many volumes of <b><i>Perry Rhodan</i></b> I collected and read, but I was a faithful fan for years.&#13;\n&#13;\n</p><p>&#13;\nAnd no wonder.  Simply put, <b><i>Perry Rhodan</i></b> is one of the richest -- if not <i>the</i> richest -- Space&#13;\nOperas ever written.  Astronaut Perry Rhodan's discovery of a stranded Arkon spacecraft on the moon&#13;\ntriggered his first adventure in <b><i>Perry Rhodan #1</i>: Enterprise Stardust</b>, sending&#13;\nRhodan and his team on a journey around the galaxy, where they discovered ancient and terrifying&#13;\nalien technology, helped unify the Earth under one government, assembled a team of human mutants to do battle&#13;\nwith an unstoppable alien menace, and went toe-to-toe with a decadent race of great age and enormous power -- all&#13;\nin the first ten issues.  The influence of a tale of this pacing and scope on the field of science fiction was significant.&#13;\nEven today, few episodes of <b><i>Babylon 5</i></b> -- arguably the finest modern Space Opera, and certainly&#13;\nthe most prevalent example today -- do not contain an element or elements which hearken back to <b><i>Perry Rhodan</i></b>&#13;\n-- from the decadent fallen Centauri Empire (shades of the Arkons) to the proliferation of ancient and deadly&#13;\nspace relics, and of course the menace of the Shadows themselves (a strong premonition of which appeared in issue 118,&#13;\n<b>The Shadows Attack</b>).&#13;\n&#13;\n</p><p>&#13;\n</p><table align=\"left\" border=\"0\">&#13;\n<tr><td>&#13;\n<a href=\"../gif/9805/pr18002.jpg\"><img src=\"../gif/9805/pr1.jpg\" border=\"0\"/></a>&#13;\n<br clear=\"all\"/>&#13;\n<center><font size=\"1\"><i>Art by Alfred Kelsner</i></font></center>&#13;\n</td></tr>&#13;\n</table>&#13;\nOver the next hundred or so volumes, Rhodan and his band of brave adventurers expanded their power base and&#13;\ntook on greater and greater threats.  One unique and fascinating aspect of the <b><i>Perry Rhodan</i></b> brand&#13;\nof pulp action was that it was not merely of the two-fisted variety.  By about issue 16 or so, Rhodan and Company&#13;\n(like Sheridan and team) represented a world government, with the burdens and responsibilities therein.  To follow&#13;\nRhodan's story was to track the Future History of humanity, across decades and eventually across centuries, as mankind&#13;\npitted itself first against lurking alien dangers, then organized ones, and finally whole Empires and ancient Galactic&#13;\nFederations.  The stakes and&#13;\nscale of the tale built slowly, with plenty of setbacks and unexpected twists, as humanity gradually took its&#13;\nplace amongst the senior races in the stars.&#13;\n<p>&#13;\nUnfortunately, while the German language version continued to build up momentum in Europe, Forry Ackerman's&#13;\ngrand experiment with a monthly pulp paperback in North America ended in 1977, after some 120 issues.  Forry&#13;\ncontinued it on a subscription-only basis until issue 137 before throwing in the towel.&#13;\n</p><p>&#13;\n</p><table align=\"right\" border=\"0\">&#13;\n<tr><td>&#13;\n<a href=\"../gif/9805/prherr2.jpg\"><img src=\"../gif/9805/pr2.jpg\" border=\"0\"/></a>&#13;\n<br clear=\"all\"/>&#13;\n<center><font size=\"1\"><i>Art by Alfred Kelsner</i></font></center>&#13;\n</td></tr>&#13;\n</table>&#13;\nAnd that, Rhodan fans assumed, was that.  Until the arrival of <i>Vector Enterprises</i> on the scene in September&#13;\nof last year -- and the first appearance of <b><i>Perry Rhodan</i></b> on this side of the Atlantic in almost twenty&#13;\nyears.  Under the leadership of Managing Editor <i>John Foyt</i> and talented translator <i>Dwight Decker</i>,&#13;\nVector Enterprises released <i><b>Perry Rhodan</b></i> as a new bimonthly magazine, starting with&#13;\n<b>1800: Time Lapse</b>, the first issue of a new storyline: <i><b>Bridge to Eternity</b></i>.  And at the&#13;\nalmost criminally bargain price of $1.95 an issue, it was a hard offer to refuse.&#13;\n<p>&#13;\nThe plot of the new issues was familiar in scope to everyone familiar with the 1970s Ace editions.  On the planet&#13;\nTrokan, known as the Second Mars, forced evolution under a Time Lapse field has created something unexpected...&#13;\nsomething that may throw humanity into crisis.  Members of Rhodan's band are called to investigate, and what they&#13;\ndiscover is far more than a temporal anomaly.  As an added bonus, the issue contained Part I of a detailed series&#13;\nsummary, filling in background info on the first 999 issues of the German edition.  Finally, the magazine offered&#13;\nan introduction by none other than <i>Forrest J. Ackerman</i> himself.&#13;\n</p><p>&#13;\n</p><table align=\"left\" border=\"0\">&#13;\n<tr><td>&#13;\n<a href=\"../gif/9806/pr3.jpg\"><img src=\"../gif/9806/pr.jpg\" border=\"0\"/></a>&#13;\n<br clear=\"all\"/>&#13;\n<center><font size=\"1\"><i>Art by Alfred Kelsner</i></font></center>&#13;\n</td></tr>&#13;\n</table>&#13;\nFoyt and his team followed up the initial magazine release in short order with issues 1801, 1802, and 1803,&#13;\nsticking to a more-or-less bimonthly schedule that has demonstrated their commitment.  The issues&#13;\nare thoroughly professional, with quality translations and fine original art, and the series summation which&#13;\nwrapped up in issue 1802 was invaluable. (Now if only they'd bring back the shock-shorts&#13;\nand other short fiction that graced the back pages of the 1970s paperback series -- and first published such folks&#13;\nas <i>Steven Utley</i> -- we'd nominate them for sainthood.)&#13;\n<p>&#13;\nFurther details, and subscription info, is available online at Vector Enterprises' <a href=\"http://www.perry-rhodan-usa.com\">website</a>.&#13;\nFor a complete review of the first three issues, see <i>Mark Shainblum</i>'s article in&#13;\n<a href=\"rho38.htm\">this issue</a> of the SF Site.&#13;\nAnd then be prepared to locate the magazines, and enjoy serial novels which&#13;\noffer complex, involving stories with an old-style mix of character and action.

You can find the basics <a href=\"https://webpack.js.org/concepts/loaders/\">here</a> and documentation on how to write a loader <a href=\"https://webpack.js.org/development/how-to-write-a-loader/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Furthermore you might want to check out the <a href=\"https://webpack.js.org/api/loaders/\">loader API</a>.</p>\n<h1 id=\"implementingaloader\">Implementing a Loader</h1>\n<p>So, you are not going to just copy paste some code from this article and feel like you finally understood webpack loaders.<br/>\nEveryday I read comments and articles where people complain about how difficult webpack is, and how everything is buggy and breaks all the time.<br/>\nIf you want it to work properly you will have to understand it. You are a developer, the experience should be nice, but does not need to be as baby proof as what we deliver to our customers.</p>\n<p>First you need to understand the webpack configuration file and its options, which I am not going to cover and assume you have some understanding of.<br/>\nWhen you get the hang of that you can go ahead and start understanding loaders.</p>\n<p>The links to the docs are above, now go and read the first two carefully.</p>\n<p>Done?<br/>\nGreat!</p>\n<p>Really. You probably just did more than 75% of self announced Frontend developers (no disrespect to the real developrs who love the frontend).<br/>\nNow go ahead and write a super simple loader that will <code>console.log</code> the contents of the files it is parsing.</p>\n<p>You can use <a href=\"https://github.com/bananenmannfrau/writing-a-webpack-loader\">this</a> repo as a starting point. Just put your loader code into the file <code>loaders/your-first-loader/index.js</code> and run the build with <code>npm run build</code>.</p>\n<p>There is a simple configuration option missing in the <code>configs/webpack.config.js</code> though.<br/>\nWithout it you will see the following error when building:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2017/10/webpackLoaderError1.png\" alt=\"webpackLoaderError1\"/></p>\n<p>If you read the second <a href=\"https://webpack.js.org/development/how-to-write-a-loader/\">link</a> you will quickly find what is missing.</p>\n<p>Hopefully I have not wasted your time, and to those of you that try it out instead of complaining about webpack, the future is yours.</p>\n</div>\n            </div></body></html>"}, "15429344": {"score": 5, "comments": [], "time": "2017-10-08 21:35:25", "url": "https://github.com/nozzle/react-static", "text": "<html><body><div><article class=\"markdown-body entry-content\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a href=\"https://travis-ci.org/nozzle/react-static\">\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://camo.githubusercontent.com/0020c317ea8b38aab9396c2990f05b20af2ace1d/68747470733a2f2f7472617669732d63692e6f72672f6e6f7a7a6c652f72656163742d7374617469632e7376673f6272616e63683d6d6173746572\" data-canonical-src=\"https://travis-ci.org/nozzle/react-static.svg?branch=master\"/>\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://npmjs.com/package/react-static\">\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://camo.githubusercontent.com/c8b3205d693e8a7d378420cb7369d5f84ae7238f/68747470733a2f2f696d672e736869656c64732e696f2f6e706d2f646d2f72656163742d7374617469632e737667\" data-canonical-src=\"https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/react-static.svg\"/>\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://react-chat-signup.herokuapp.com/\">\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://camo.githubusercontent.com/4a927a3b216b428cdfb3aaa63ade71504b6b7f2c/68747470733a2f2f696d672e736869656c64732e696f2f62616467652f736c61636b2d72656163742d2d636861742d626c75652e737667\" data-canonical-src=\"https://img.shields.io/badge/slack-react--chat-blue.svg\"/>\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/nozzle/react-static\">\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://camo.githubusercontent.com/5e58145770de9f5c6e4943cc737019591dfb39c9/68747470733a2f2f696d672e736869656c64732e696f2f6769746875622f73746172732f6e6f7a7a6c652f72656163742d7374617469632e7376673f7374796c653d736f6369616c266c6162656c3d53746172\" data-canonical-src=\"https://img.shields.io/github/stars/nozzle/react-static.svg?style=social&amp;label=Star\"/>\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/nozzleio\">\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://camo.githubusercontent.com/02d059476f09499b2824740d69d983341c2e5c7f/68747470733a2f2f696d672e736869656c64732e696f2f747769747465722f666f6c6c6f772f6e6f7a7a6c65696f2e7376673f7374796c653d736f6369616c266c6162656c3d466f6c6c6f77\" data-canonical-src=\"https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/nozzleio.svg?style=social&amp;label=Follow\"/>\n</a>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<h1><a href=\"#react-static\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\" id=\"user-content-react-static\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"octicon octicon-link\" version=\"1.1\" viewbox=\"0 0 16 16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"/></svg></a>React Static</h1>\n<p>A <strong>progressive static-site framework</strong> for React.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/@tannerlinsley/%EF%B8%8F-introducing-react-static-a-progressive-static-site-framework-for-react-3470d2a51ebc\"><strong>Read the introduction article on Medium</strong></a></p>\n<p>At <a href=\"https://nozzle.io\">Nozzle.io</a>, we take <strong>SEO, site performance, and user/developer experience</strong> very seriously.

It accepts a <code>history</code> object like you're used to (to support things like react-router-redux), and also provides a helper method to subscribe to loading events.</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<div

It consisted of a webcam in some guy's basement and a whole load of electronic toys you could play with remotely including a model train, an RC mini and a crane. I remember hours of enjoyment using the site especially when I managed to pick up the car with the crane and lower it onto the railway track and ram it with the train.</p>\n<p>It suddenly occured to me that I could re-live the madness in my own home and decided to trial it over the Christmas period from 1st December until 31st December 2017. So far I have dug out my old childhood train set and started building an internet connected controller to control the train, unfortunately budget probably won't stretch to a crane as well although I'll probably put up a Christmas tree within the circle of train track with some internet controlled lights to keep with the festive theme.</p>\n<p>The train is a simple affair with a variable DC current passed through the track between 0 and 12v, initially I thought about cannibalising an existing model railway controller but I soon realised controlling the motor using the PWM output of an Arduino ATMega328PU, a Darlington pair and a H Bridge would probably achieve a decent serial controlled controller at a very low cost, and would be more favourable than buying a model railway controller for conversation as even a simple analog model railway controller retails for around \u00c2\u00a340.</p>\n<p>I sourced a few parts from my electronics stuff drawer and ordered some other items from eBay, first I found a decent 20V AC powersupply capable of deliverying 1A with thermal cut out and some nice protection features in my storage box. Although more work than just getting a straight forward 12V DC powersupply I decided this was worth the effort rather than buying some cheap substandard supply from eBay. I hooked this up with some diodes forming a full wave bridge rectifier along with a smoothing capacitor and an L7812CV voltage regulator to give a nice smooth 12V supply to work with.</p>\n<p>Next as the h-bridge ICs have not arrived from eBay yet I wanted to check I could use PWM succesfully to vary the voltage to the track using some transistor, of course with this configuration I would not be able to change direction, only vary speed. Based on the use case I chose a TIP120 Darlington pair on the ground return from the track. Due to the lack of h-bridges I only used a breadboard at this stage to test the circuit and I kept the ATMega328PU in an Arduino Uno boardpowered over the PC's USB for simplicity and ease of changing stuff around, although for the final project the micro controller will be broken out of the Uno and used directly within the circuit using an L7805CV 5V regulator for power along with a 16mhz crystal and a few 10pF capacitors.</p>\n<p>Here is a very back of napkin style sketch of my setup for testing...</p>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.robertputt.co.uk/images/20171008/circuit1.jpg\"/>\n<p>I constructed the above on a breadboard adding a heatsink to the 12V regulator and the TIP120 as I expect these will get pretty warm, then I got to work writing some basic Arduino code to allow setting the PWM duty cycle using serial input. Here is the result:</p>\n<pre class=\"literal-block\">\nint mspeedpin = 9;\nint mspeed = 0;\nint integerValue;\n\nvoid setup() {\n  Serial.begin(9600);\n  pinMode(mspeedpin, OUTPUT);\n}\n\nvoid loop() {\n  integerValue = Serial.parseInt();\n  Serial.println(integerValue);\n  if (integerValue &gt; 150) {\n    mspeed = integerValue;\n    Serial.println(\"Set new speed\");\n  } else if (integerValue == 1) {\n    mspeed = 0;\n    Serial.println(\"Train stopped\");\n  } else {\n    Serial.println(\"Invalid command / speed\");\n  }\n  analogWrite(mspeedpin, mspeed);\n}\n</pre>\n<p>By default the serial gets parsed as 0 if no input is given so I simply ignore items with a 0 input and instead set an input of 1 to set the duty cycle to 0% to stop the tain as an input of 1 would not usually be used as the train only really starts moving at around 60% duty cycle. Below this amount the voltage is too low to get any movement hence adding the if statement ensuring that only values above 150 set the speed, anything below this would risk causing damage to the motor. The serial console in Arduino will now accept the following values:</p>\n<ul class=\"simple\">\n<li>0 = No input, ignore and continue</li>\n<li>1 = Stop the train</li>\n<li>150 - 255 = Vary the speed of the train between ~58% - 100%</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Then I put a train on the track and tried sending a few commands via serial, to my joy it ran around the track with varying speed, when the h-bridge arrives I'll fit it into the circuit to get bi-directional control working before moving on to some basic short circuit protection in case the train falls off the track and causes a short. Following this I'll get it all mounted on some prototyping board and build an API for interacting with the controller over the internet.</p>\n<p>Anyway here is a short video of testing the above, you'll notice the train's speed doesnt vary greatly, unfortunately this model is very old and is a bit all or nothing, I may try and dig out a newer model from my collection as I suspect these would handle the lower voltages better. On the first lap it runs at around 60% duty cycle increasing by 10% on each subsequent lap until full speed and then ramping back down again, the stuttering over on the left hand side is caused by some dirt on the track and is not related to the controller.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GuNzo2_p5xg\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\">VIDEO</iframe><p>I will update once the h-bridge arrives and the project is progressing, closer to the go live date I'll link to the control page so you can all have a play.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-7205601062973662\" data-ad-slot=\"4798674690\" data-ad-format=\"auto\"/>\n\n\n        </div>\n        </div></body></html>"}, "15429586": {"score": 1, "comments": [], "time": "2017-10-08 22:34:37", "url": "http://www.barttar.com", "text": "<html><body><div><div class=\"terms-page-content-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"terms-page-content-sub\">\n<h5 class=\"terms-page-content-sub-title\">\nCreating a barttar\n</h5>\n<p class=\"terms-page-content-sub-text\">\nYou probably remember barttar as the earliest form of trade, while we weren\u2019t there when this was the standard form of trade worldwide,\nthe belief in this pure form of transaction inspired this platform.

When the address came through I turned around, turned right, and arrived at the apartment complex in about 4 minutes. I called the provided number. A woman's voice gave directions to a building in the back of the complex. \n</p><p>\nA group came out; a woman in her 20's got in the cab. An older male stood outside and gave directions to where his truck was parked. As we pulled away the passenger said, in a flustered voice, \u201cI don't know why he messes with her, she's like 20 years younger...\u201d, and this wasn't the first time they'd had to take a taxi or a bus to get the truck back. \n</p><p>\nI didn't care, because I was happy to have a longer trip than someone going across the street with groceries. I broke into my standard line of questions.\n</p><p>\nBefore long she asked me her own question: \"Did you ever pick a girl up downtown, take her to [West-Valley city], and </p><i>she wasn't able to pay?</i><p>\"\n</p><p>\n'I would do that. Let me think.... ... .. .' I glanced at my passenger to jog my memory. Recently: no. Semi-recently: no. Then I remembered, 'THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO!' I looked at my passenger again, 'Was that... YOU?', and cautiously confirmed that I had. \n</p><p>\nShe said with glee, </p><i>\"THAT WAS ME!\"</i>\n<p>\nI remembered her trip well.\n\n</p><a name=\"more\"/><h3>\nAlmost 2 years earlier...</h3>\n<p>\nI tended to stay in the areas north of the Salt River, but I worked wherever the passengers took me. On that night I'd just gotten off I-17 at 7th St. A fellow was on the off-ramp asking for change. I asked what he was planning to buy. He said he just wanted a cup of coffee. That sounded reasonable, so I gave him a few quarters. \"What's your name?\"\n</p><p>\n\"Maverick, really!\" He quickly produced his state-issued ID card and showed it to me. \n</p><p>\nI was about to drive away when I realized that I'd had all of the coconut pie I could stomach, and that I might as well give the other half away to someone who'd appreciate it. He took the pie gratefully, the light turned green, and I turned south to go under the freeway. Seconds later I was offered a fare to the north, so I turned around. Maverick was strutting along with the pie box, like he'd just won the lottery.\n</p><p>\nThe provided address and phone number was for a cheap motel in downtown Phoenix. A woman promptly appeared when I pulled up and got in the cab. She was obviously distraught, and urgently said \u201cGO GO GO!\u201d\n</p><p>\nShe asked to go to one of the cities in the west valley - it was a bit of a drive.\n</p><p>\nI was more cautious than usual with my standard questions, and my passenger's story gradually revealed itself. Her boyfriend had some sort of cancer which was in and out of remission. They were economically stressed - without jobs, staying with friends,\u00a0 and dependent on the kindness of others to survive. \n</p><p>\nA few hours earlier this passenger had been out walking her dog in the quiet neighborhood around her friend's house. Then someone said, \"YOU, FREEZE!\" huh, whut? \"YOU'RE UNDER ARREST!\" It was a public servant. \n</p><p>\nMy passenger asked why she was under arrest, but the public servant was dismissive, in a \u201cyou know what you did\u201d sort of way. Eventually she learned what she was being accused of. She protested that she hadn't been to the convenience store that night, and that she most certainly was NOT the petty beer thief the public servants were looking for. But the officers were looking for a blonde white woman, and she was the first person they found matching this description. They'd taken my passenger downtown, and began the process of booking her into Sheriff Arpaio's Gulag (\"County Jail\" - the now-deposed </p><a href=\"http://www.taxiwars.org/2017/09/americas-make-work-sheriff-anachronism.html\" target=\"\">Sherriff of Maricopa was notorious for his cruelty</a><p>).\n</p><p>\nSome time later the city cops in the west valley found the petty beer thief they were actually looking for, and they released their mistaken arrestee (my passenger) from the\u00a0 4th Avenue Jail. \u201c... Aren't you going to take me back to [west-valley]?\u201d She thought they would take her back to where she'd been mistakenly arrested, but the public servants told her she could call for a taxi.\n</p><p>\nShe didn't have quarters to use the payphone, and eventually found her way to the cheap motel. The staff lent use of their phone to call the taxi company. Her hope was that the friend whose house she was staying at could pay her fare, but this concern was secondary to getting out of the scary area surrounding Arpaio's Gulag.\n</p><p>\nWhen we were almost to her friend's house a very important question occurred to me: </p><i>\"What happened to your dog?\" </i><p>Maybe I shouldn't have asked, as she didn't know.\n</p><p>\nShe also didn't know the exact address of where she was staying. Eventually the house was found and my passenger went inside. After a few minutes she returned with her friend, who apologized profusely for not having any cash. We tried his prepaid debit card, which was supposed to have funds from a tax refund soon, but it didn't authorize, for any amount. She wanted to make arrangements for later payment.\n</p><p>\nI depended on my passengers being able to pay their fares so that I could buy fuel and otherwise support myself. But it was clear that this woman was genuinely distraught, and she had a good story. I left a card and said she could pay when she could.\n</p><p>\n(The friend said that animal control had been called to collect the dog.)\n\n</p><h3>\nA Most-Appreciative Passenger </h3>\n<p>\nWhen we met again, this woman shared how appreciative she was that I'd helped her out at our first encounter, years before. She'd always wanted to pay me, but had lost my card. How long had it been? Neither of us remembered.\n</p><p>\nShe has a job now, \u201cat a mortuary, of all places...\u201d, and her boyfriend is doing well.\n</p><p>\n\"Did you get your dog back?\" They'd posted fliers around the neighborhood, which led to the return of her dog.\n</p><p>\nShe paid the fare to get to her friend's truck. I didn't remember her earlier fare amount, and took slightly less than was offered. I spent a few minutes looking for notes from that night on my laptop, but nothing turned up in my searches. Before long another fare was offered - 3.5 miles away, at the Sprouts on West Peoria - and I was off for another trip.\n</p><p>\nIt wasn't until working on this write-up that I remembered giving Maverick the pie that night (which was intended for \"the alcoholic\", because it was on sale at Whole Foods &amp; alcoholics are always malnourished, but the intended pie-recipient didn't answer her phone that day). That marks the day of my first encounter with this woman as the closing days of December 2012; the second encounter was in November of 2014.\n\n</p><h3>\nFairness, justice, and anti-justice </h3>\n<p>\n\"Tom\" drove the cab for our little team 5 nights a week. Tom used to be a police officer in the American south. He drives cab for the adventure, and to supplement his pension. One weekend I messaged to say that I'd finished for the day, and had dropped the cab off. He responded that he was at the Italian food place a half mile away.\n</p><p>\nIn our chat that night Tom mentioned smelling really aromatic marijuana on some recent south-Phoenix passengers - not \u201cspice crap\", but something more pleasant. I commented that he used to fight in </p><a href=\"http://howdoigethigh.com/\" target=\"_blank\">the war on plants</a><p>.\n</p><p>\n\"They told me it was a gateway drug, </p><i>and I believed them</i><p>. Now it seems that the plant actually has health benefits.\"\u00a0 Then he remembered a teenager who tried to hide a joint from Police Officer Tom. \"I probably ruined that kid's life,\" he said with a chuckle. It was a long time ago. It was just part of the job.\n\n</p><h4>\nMany types of criminals</h4>\n<p>\nOn the one hand, public servants are tasked with protecting society from violence and predation. On the other hand, politicians have also tasked our public servants with the sick (addicts and mentally ill), the poor, political criminals who haven't hurt anyone, and those who make mistakes.\n</p><p>\nA wise woman I know once said, \u201cwhen a person feels safe, the false ego goes away.\" People who don't feel safe cause problems not because they're bad people who need to be taught a lesson by being thrown in a cage, but because they don't have the resources to make better choices.\n</p><p>\nFinancially-secure people who are arrested for mistakes tend to get the catch-and-release treatment. People with money to burn can hire a good attorney to possibly get them off, or at least to effectively negotiate with the prosecutor on their behalf. My </p><a href=\"http://www.taxiwars.org/who-are-your-lifelines/\">who are your lifelines?</a><p> passenger said he used to have an attorney who could \"take care\" of her clients' problems by schmoozing with the prosecutors.\n</p><p>\nThe media makes a big deal about race, but I think the issue is more one of class: poor white people get traumatized by Justice too.\n\n</p><h3>\nThe Public Servants' Quagmire</h3>\n<p>\nPolice officers have a bit of a predicament: their official motto is to \"protect and serve\", but the politicians have given them no flexibility to fulfill their role.\n</p><p>\nAfter I retired from taxi driving, I spent a couple days at fire school. During the opening ceremony I realized the difference between firefighters and police officers/sheriff's deputies.\n</p><p>\nIf the fire department is dispatched, they will do whatever they can to try to help you. Firetrucks are completely outfitted with all sorts of equipment that might be needed to save someone's day. These include not just fire hoses and axes, but also tools to cut up cars to extract people when the doors won't open, etc. Equipment on this Mesa firetruck was once used to lift the light-rail train off of a drunk who'd passed out on the tracks:\n\n</p><table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\"><tbody>\n<tr><td><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-C8RTWWduR0Q/Wdpk8Dwy1uI/AAAAAAAAANQ/SDtdS-zQh24S-m7oB_p4G1NKDnCYng6yQCLcBGAs/s1600/Mesa%2BFD%2B-%2BRapid%2BResponse%252C%2BSpecial%2BOperations.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"1200\" data-original-width=\"1600\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-C8RTWWduR0Q/Wdpk8Dwy1uI/AAAAAAAAANQ/SDtdS-zQh24S-m7oB_p4G1NKDnCYng6yQCLcBGAs/s200/Mesa%2BFD%2B-%2BRapid%2BResponse%252C%2BSpecial%2BOperations.jpg\"/></a></td></tr>\n<tr><td class=\"tr-caption\">Mesa Fire Department's Rapid Response/Special Operations Firetruck</td></tr>\n</tbody></table><p>\nNo judgement calls are made by firefighters when responding to the incident at hand. In a future post I intend to tell of the time that I had to call in some firefighters to save the day. After the firefighters had disappeared into the night, the also-dispatched police officers completed their \"investigation\" and decided they didn't need to make the situation worse.\n</p><p>\nDiscretion is the police officer's most important skill. But police are frequently pressured (performance evaluations, etc) to take actions that really just needlessly wreck people's lives. \n</p><p>\nAnother passenger, whom I may expand on more fully, told of the time she was being unruly, and her family called the police for help. After a while those police officers decided they didn't have any way to help, so \"we're going to have to take you downtown.\" Her adult daughter protested, \"THIS IS NOT WHY WE CALLED YOU\", but the police officers were like, \"whatevers\". Arresting people is their job, even if that person really only needs a time-out from their situation.\n\n</p><h3>\nVarieties of Rendition: Ordinary vs. Extraordinary </h3>\n<p>\nDuring the George W. Bush administration, the United States government's use of \"Extraordinary Rendition\" was sporadically covered by the media:\n</p><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">\n<b>Extraordinary rendition</b> is the government-sponsored abduction and extrajudicial transfer of a person from one country to another that has predominantly been carried out by the United States government with the consent of other countries. [...]<br/>\n<br/>\nThe United Nations considers one nation abducting the citizens of another a crime against humanity. [...] (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraordinary_rendition\">Wikipedia</a>)</blockquote><p>\nOrdinary rendition is the corollary event, when a person gets transferred from one area to another as a part of normal police operations. Public servants should realize that they have a duty to make sure people are not overly traumatized by their ordinary practices. \n\n</p><p/>\n</div>\n</div></body></html>"}, "15430898": {"score": 1, "comments": [], "time": "2017-10-09 03:54:08", "url": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-41518351", "text": "<html><body><div><div class=\"story-body__inner\" property=\"articleBody\">\n        <figure class=\"media-landscape has-caption full-width lead\">\n            <span class=\"image-and-copyright-container\">\n                \n                <img class=\"js-image-replace\" alt=\"Mining hardware\" src=\"https://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/13DF/production/_98178050_gettyimages-840546732.jpg\"/>\n                \n                \n                \n                 <span class=\"off-screen\">Image copyright</span>\n                 <span class=\"story-image-copyright\">Vichai</span>\n                \n            </span>\n            \n            <figcaption class=\"media-caption\">\n                <span class=\"off-screen\">Image caption</span>\n                <span class=\"media-caption__text\">\n                    Generating crypto-currencies involves lots of computer hardware\n                </span>\n            </figcaption>\n            \n        </figure><p class=\"story-body__introduction\">School, charity and file-sharing websites have been caught out by scammers who are using them to generate crypto-cash.</p><p>Hackers have managed to install code on the sites that uses visitors' computers to \"mine\" the cyber-currencies. </p><p>One scan of the most popular websites found hundreds harbouring the malicious mining code.</p><p>By getting lots of computers to join the networks, attackers can quickly generate cash.</p><p>\"This is absolutely a numbers game,\" said Rik Ferguson, vice-president of security research at Trend Micro. </p><h2 class=\"story-body__crosshead\">Malicious use</h2><p>Mr Ferguson said crypto-currencies operated by getting lots of computers to work together to solve the tricky mathematical problems that generate new digital \"coins\".</p><p>The number crunching is called mining and new crypto-coins are handed out to miners who are the first to solve the complex sums.</p><p>The more computer power that someone can amass, said Mr Ferguson, the more coins they can generate. </p><p>\"There's a huge attraction of being able to use other people's devices in a massively distributed fashion because you then effectively take advantage of a huge amount of computing resources,\" he said.</p><figure class=\"media-landscape has-caption full-width\">\n            <span class=\"image-and-copyright-container\">\n                \n                \n                <p class=\"js-delayed-image-load\" data-alt=\"Coin Hive script\" data-src=\"https://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/79AB/production/_98174113_lukeshive.jpg\" data-width=\"976\" data-height=\"549\"/>\n                \n                \n            </span>\n            \n            <figcaption class=\"media-caption\">\n                <span class=\"off-screen\">Image caption</span>\n                <span class=\"media-caption__text\">\n                    Some sites were running lots of copies of the script\n                </span>\n            </figcaption>\n            \n        </figure><p>\"Crypto-coin mining malware is nothing new,\" said Mr Ferguson, adding that the growing value of established cyber-currencies and the emergence of potentially valuable new ones was driving malicious use of the scripts.</p><p>A security researcher has scanned the code behind the million most popular websites to see which ones are running the widely used Coin Hive mining script.</p><p>Many sites use this and others, such as JSE Coin, legitimately to generate some money from their steady stream of visitors.

It provides a language-level construct for synchronously executing asynchronous actions, making your JavaScript code\u2019s control flow significantly easier to follow.</p>\n\n<p>Below is an example of an async function:</p>\n\n<figure class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"language-js\" data-lang=\"js\"><span class=\"kd\">const</span> <span class=\"nx\">waitToSayHello</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"k\">async</span><span class=\"p\">()</span> <span class=\"o\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"kr\">await</span> <span class=\"nb\">Promise</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">delay</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">2000</span><span class=\"p\">);</span> <span class=\"c1\">// Bluebird utility function</span>\n    <span class=\"nx\">console</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">log</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s2\">\"Hello!\"</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n<span class=\"p\">};</span></code></pre></figure>\n\n<p>The code above is extremely clear: wait for 2 seconds and log. Async/await eliminates the need for timeout callbacks by allowing to specify waiting on asynchronous actions.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"why-have-i-not-been-using-async-functions\">Why have I not been using async functions?</h1>\n<p>Async functions become more complicated when you have to handle rejected promises. Take the code below, which fetches a Bookshelf User model by email, adds a token on to it, and returns a response from a server:</p>\n\n<figure class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"language-js\" data-lang=\"js\"><span class=\"kd\">const</span> <span class=\"nx\">fetchUserByEmail</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"k\">async</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">email</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"kd\">const</span> <span class=\"nx\">user</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kr\">await</span> <span class=\"nx\">User</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">forge</span><span class=\"p\">({</span> <span class=\"nx\">email</span> <span class=\"p\">}).</span><span class=\"nx\">fetch</span><span class=\"p\">();</span>\n    <span class=\"nx\">user</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"kd\">set</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s2\">\"token\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nx\">getToken</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">user</span><span class=\"p\">));</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"nx\">User</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">save</span><span class=\"p\">();</span>\n<span class=\"p\">};</span>\n\n<span class=\"nx\">fetchUserByEmail</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s2\">\"<a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\" class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"67020310061503270515060a0609130e490a02\">[email\u00a0protected]</a>\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">then</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">user</span> <span class=\"o\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\"nx\">reply</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">user</span><span class=\"p\">));</span></code></pre></figure>\n\n<p>Let\u2019s say if <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\" class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"aecbcad9cfdccaeeccdccfc3cfc0dac780c3cb\">[email\u00a0protected]</a></code> is not found in the database when the user is fetched, the fetch promise rejects with an error called <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">UserNotFoundError</code>. We want to respond with a 404 for that particular error type and allow all other errors to throw and be caught by our server. There are two ways to handle an error with an async function:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>A try/catch block inside the async function.</li>\n  <li>A catch block where the async function is called.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>There are <a href=\"https://blog.patricktriest.com/what-is-async-await-why-should-you-care/\">plenty of examples online</a> about the first option, but in this particular case, I want to focus on #2. Here is what our implementation could look like:</p>\n\n<figure class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"language-js\" data-lang=\"js\"><span class=\"kd\">const</span> <span class=\"nx\">fetchUserByEmail</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"k\">async</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">email</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"kd\">const</span> <span class=\"nx\">user</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kr\">await</span> <span class=\"nx\">User</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">forge</span><span class=\"p\">({</span> <span class=\"nx\">email</span> <span class=\"p\">}).</span><span class=\"nx\">fetch</span><span class=\"p\">();</span>\n    <span class=\"nx\">user</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"kd\">set</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s2\">\"token\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nx\">getToken</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">user</span><span class=\"p\">));</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"nx\">User</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">save</span><span class=\"p\">();</span>\n<span class=\"p\">};</span>\n\n<span class=\"nx\">fetchUserByEmail</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s2\">\"<a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\" class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"41242536203325012333202c202f35286f2c24\">[email\u00a0protected]</a>\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">then</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">user</span> <span class=\"o\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\"nx\">reply</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">user</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"k\">catch</span><span class=\"p\">((</span><span class=\"nx\">e</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">e</span> <span class=\"k\">instanceof</span> <span class=\"nx\">UserNotFoundError</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n            <span class=\"nx\">reply</span><span class=\"p\">().</span><span class=\"nx\">code</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">404</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n        <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n\n        <span class=\"k\">throw</span> <span class=\"nx\">e</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">})</span></code></pre></figure>\n\n<p>The problem here is that the <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">catch</code> block passes all error conditions to one function callback. If there is more than one error type, you need multiple conditional <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">instanceof</code> checks, which makes your callback longer and more complex. This may not seem like an issue, since we do handle the <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">UserNotFoundError</code>. Nevertheless, we have to re-throw if the error does not match conditional <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">instanceof</code> check. If you forget to re-throw, this could cause your server to hang in that block because it has not escaped asynchronous execution.</p>\n\n<p>Bluebird (and in particular, <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">Promise.coroutine</code>) diverges from async functions because it supports a feature called <a href=\"http://bluebirdjs.com/docs/api/catch.html#filtered-catch\">filtered catch</a>. This feature allows you to specify one or more error constructors to be handled by a specific callback. This is available in many other languages, such as C# and Java, and is incredibly useful for handling different exception types.</p>\n\n<p>Using <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">Promise.coroutine</code> we can make use of this feature in a similar manner to async functions:</p>\n\n<figure class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"language-js\" data-lang=\"js\"><span class=\"kd\">const</span> <span class=\"nx\">fetchUserByEmail</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nb\">Promise</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">coroutine</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"kd\">function</span><span class=\"o\">*</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">email</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"kd\">const</span> <span class=\"nx\">user</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"k\">yield</span> <span class=\"nx\">User</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">forge</span><span class=\"p\">({</span> <span class=\"nx\">email</span> <span class=\"p\">}).</span><span class=\"nx\">fetch</span><span class=\"p\">();</span>\n    <span class=\"nx\">user</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"kd\">set</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s2\">\"token\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nx\">getToken</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">user</span><span class=\"p\">));</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"nx\">User</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">save</span><span class=\"p\">();</span>\n<span class=\"p\">};</span>\n\n<span class=\"nx\">fetchUserByEmail</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s2\">\"<a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\" class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"aacfceddcbd8ceeac8d8cbc7cbc4dec384c7cf\">[email\u00a0protected]</a>\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">then</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">user</span> <span class=\"o\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\"nx\">reply</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">user</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"k\">catch</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">UserNotFoundError</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"p\">()</span> <span class=\"o\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\"nx\">reply</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">code</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">404</span><span class=\"p\">));</span></code></pre></figure>\n\n<p>Filtered catching <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/catch\">is not supported by the ES6\u2019s native Promise implementation</a>, which is why I have avoided using async/await and have stuck to using <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">Promise.coroutine</code>. The problem is clear: async/await returns a promise that does not support the useful, granular filtered catch that I need to cleanly handle the multiple different types of errors I could experience inside these functions.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"my-solution-to-error-handling-hell\">My solution to \u201cerror handling hell\u201d</h1>\n<p>To get filtered catch support, I need async functions to return a Bluebird promise. Bluebird has a utility function called <a href=\"http://bluebirdjs.com/docs/api/promise.method.html\"><code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">Promise.method</code></a>, which we can wrap our async function with to return a Bluebird promise with filtered catch support:</p>\n\n<figure class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"language-js\" data-lang=\"js\"><span class=\"kd\">const</span> <span class=\"nx\">fetchUserByEmail</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nb\">Promise</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">method</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\">async</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">email</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"kd\">const</span> <span class=\"nx\">user</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kr\">await</span> <span class=\"nx\">User</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">forge</span><span class=\"p\">({</span> <span class=\"nx\">email</span> <span class=\"p\">}).</span><span class=\"nx\">fetch</span><span class=\"p\">();</span>\n    <span class=\"nx\">user</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"kd\">set</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s2\">\"token\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nx\">getToken</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">user</span><span class=\"p\">));</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"nx\">User</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">save</span><span class=\"p\">();</span>\n<span class=\"p\">});</span></code></pre></figure>\n\n<p>Now, our called promise error handling looks exactly like it did with <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">Promise.coroutine</code>:</p>\n\n<figure class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"language-js\" data-lang=\"js\"><span class=\"nx\">fetchUserByEmail</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s2\">\"<a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\" class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"3c59584b5d4e587c5e4e5d515d524855125159\">[email\u00a0protected]</a>\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">then</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">user</span> <span class=\"o\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\"nx\">reply</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">user</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"k\">catch</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">UserNotFoundError</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nx\">reply</span><span class=\"p\">().</span><span class=\"nx\">code</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">404</span><span class=\"p\">));</span></code></pre></figure>\n\n<p>This is much cleaner, and now gives async/await functions all the power of Bluebird\u2019s <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">catch</code>.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"why-is-this-a-big-deal\">Why is this a big deal?</h1>\n<p>Particularly with Node, I find myself performing multiple asynchronous actions that return different error types. Filtered catch allows you to clearly express your exception handling with discrete catch blocks, which has an added benefit of making your error handling code more readable. It is the reason why I still use Bluebird over native ES6 promises, and I will most likely continue to do so until it becomes a feature in native promises.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"further-examplesreading\">Further Examples/Reading</h1>\n<p>I made an example with a custom error type <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/arvyf8r3/\">here on JSFiddle</a>, go check it out!</p>\n\n<p>Another way to solve error handling in async function is to use <a href=\"https://github.com/scopsy/await-to-js\">Dima Grossman\u2019s await-to-js</a> package. Instead of using Bluebird promises, he uses a wrapper to return errors like the Go programming language. The wrapper returns a 2-element array with the first element being an error/null and the second element being the resolved value. The syntax becomes much cleaner with ES6 using destructuring statements, and is an interesting take on the issue.

According to the United Nations, the United States is the <a href=\"http://comtrade.un.org/pb/FileFetch.aspx?docID=5468&amp;type=commodity%20pages\">biggest exporter of used clothes</a>, and the top importing countries of used clothing are India, Russia and Pakistan.</p>   <p>But with the strong dollar and availability of cheap clothing from Asia, <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=rloiBQAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA233&amp;ots=1d1_LSFYFJ&amp;sig=7nBHhN2i3VINNSZivHjvtiokAZY#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\">some are worried</a> that demand for exports of secondhand clothing will decline \u2014 thus forcing developed nations to find new ways to deal with post-consumer textile waste.</p>   <p>Fast fashion and the disposable culture also hurt sorting companies that export second-hand clothing.</p>   <p>Adam Baruchowitz, founder of <a href=\"http://wearablecollections.com/\">Wearable Collections</a> in New York City, collects second-hand clothing and sells it to sorting companies. The companies then sort through the clothes, separating those that will be made into other low-grade fiber products and those that will be exported.</p>   <p>Baruchowitz says the most valuable part of a sorting company's business is in selling reusable second-hand clothing. But if the quality is questionable, more of the garments collected might have to head to the shredding bin rather than the second-hand clothes market.</p>   <p>\"It's very damaging to the environment, this fast fashion culture, and it also affects the secondhand market because these clothes aren't meant to be used for so long,\" he says. \"I can't say for sure, but the secondhand H&amp;Ms would probably be in less demand than a garment that was produced with more quality. I'm getting all this stuff from fast fashion and I'm hearing from clients that it's hurting them.\"</p>   <p><strong>Do Retailers' Recycling Programs Encourage Consumerism?</strong></p>   <p>Several clothing retailers have announced <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/fashion/la-ig-green-incentive-20151011-story.html\">take-back programs</a> that collect used garments from customers to be recycled, sold or remade into other clothing. <a href=\"http://about.hm.com/en/About/sustainability/commitments/reduce-waste/garment-collecting.html\">H&amp;M</a>, for example, has allowed customers to bring unwanted garments \u2014 which will be transformed to recycled textile fibers for new products \u2014 since 2013. The company aims to have \"zero garments going to landfill.\" <a href=\"http://www.patagonia.com/us/reuse-recycle\">Patagonia</a> also recycles and sells used Patagonia products in its stores.</p>   \n   \n\n   <p>It plays into the concept of extended producer responsibility, which means the manufacturer has to take into consideration the product's afterlife.</p>   <p>But does it actually encourage more consumerism? For many stores, customers can get store credit and vouchers for sending in used clothing.</p>   <p>\"If you bring it back to the store and you see something new and you're going to give me a discount, I'm having a buying moment I may not have had before because you're having me back at your store. It's very smart in terms of business,\" Lewis says.</p>   <p>The concept, however, might encourage a different type of thinking: If manufacturers have to think about how they're going to get the most out of the product after it has been worn, Lewis says, it might spur them to start designing products that can be taken apart easily, have better quality, or might be biodegradable, for example.</p>   <p>H&amp;M <a href=\"http://about.hm.com/en/news/newsroom/news.html/en_us/world-recycle-week-2016.html\">introduced new garments</a> made of recycled textile fibers two year ago.</p>   <p><strong>Grassroots Efforts To Counter Fast Fashion</strong></p>   <div id=\"res473514216\" class=\"bucketwrap video youtube-video large\">\n    <p class=\"video-wrap\">\n        <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dTZFGUG9u2U?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\">VIDEO</iframe>\n    </p>\n        <div class=\"credit-caption externalasset\">\n            <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTZFGUG9u2U&amp;list=PLhQMimdrfRvcd0LlPORCGXcFrek5OYQb4&amp;index=2\">CutiePieMarza</a>, a YouTuber from England, uploads a video of her clothes swap with grav3yardgirl, a Youtuber from Texas.</p>\n\n                <b class=\"credit\">\n                    \n                    <b class=\"source\">YouTube</b>\n                </b>\n        </div>\n</div>\n   <p>A year ago, a few users began uploading YouTube videos of themselves exchanging clothes with friends.

As we already know a Bitcoin Block contains a <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/primitives/block.h#L23\">Header </a>and a collection of <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/primitives/block.h#L76\">Transactions</a>. We\u2019ve already learned about how important Headers are and how they constitute a back-linked <em>block-chain</em> that helps to maintain the integrity of recorded transactions. Now the two new questions are: W<em>hat does a Transaction look like? </em><strong>and</strong> <em>How do we use it to transfer coins from address to address</em>? And just like in the previous article I\u2019ll be presenting a simplified C++ code here, while the real C++ code will be pointed to via links to <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin\">Bitcoin\u2019s GitHub repository</a>.</span></p><h3><span>Transaction\u2019s Structure</span></h3><p><span>Without wanting to make your reading experience more complicated than it already is, I\u2019ll start with the unpleasant fact first: actually, there are <strong>two types</strong> of <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/primitives/transaction.h#L264\">transactions</a>! <em>Regular</em> ones and C<em>oinbase\u00a0</em>Transactions. And they can be found in each block, side by side. And yes, there\u2019s a reason for that, but before we go any deeper into that matter, let\u2019s first examine the regular transaction\u2019s structure only. This will surely help us a lot to understand more easily the <em>Coinbase</em> Transactions later.</span></p><p/><table><tbody><tr><td>\u00a0<span><strong>Field</strong></span></td><td>\u00a0<span><strong>Role</strong></span></td><td>\u00a0<span><strong>Type</strong></span></td></tr><tr><td><span>Version</span></td><td><span>Indicates the Transaction Format Version</span></td><td><span>numeric</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>NumberOfInputs</span></td><td><span> Number of Entries in the Collection of Inputs</span></td><td><span>numeric</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>CollectionOfInputs</span></td><td><span>Collection Input Entries (BTCs <em>to redeem</em>)</span></td><td><span>vector of objects</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>NumberOfOutputs</span></td><td><span>Number of Entries in the Collection of Outputs</span></td><td><span> numeric</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>CollectionOfOutputs</span></td><td><span>Collection of Output Entries (BTCs <em>to spend</em>)</span></td><td><span> vector of objects</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>LockTimestamp</span></td><td><span>Time-Window <em>allowing the Transactions to be replaced</em> in this Block\u00a0</span></td><td><span> numeric</span></td></tr></tbody></table><p><span>At the first sight this complex structure isn\u2019t in any way helping us to understand how a BTC can find its way from sender to recipient. However, if we recall that \u201c<em>Bitcoin thinks in Transactions only</em>\u201d then the whole structure becomes a little clearer. Bitcoin has no senders, recipients or any kind of entities that own BTCs. Transactions are the only available entity that can be used <strong>to reclaim a possession of bitcoins</strong>! </span></p><p><span>Therefore, to send a BTC to an address we first have to prove that we\u2019ve successfully redeemed this BTC from a <em>previous </em>Transaction<em> output</em>\u00a0that\u2019s now a Transaction\u00a0<em>input</em>\u00a0in the current Block. Or more technically: to be able to put a certain amount of BTC into the <em>output</em> vector of our Block we must have been able to redeem the same amount of BTC from some <em>previous output</em>\u00a0vector. It doesn\u2019t have to be a single output as only the final amount of BTC counts. We could also have redeemed BTCs from several previous Transaction outputs just to create a single Transaction output in our own Block. <strong>What\u2019s important is the equilibrium between the incoming and outgoing amounts of BTC</strong>. Therefore, to understand how those two collections work together we have to dissect their structures as well.</span></p><h3><span>Transaction Inputs &amp; Outputs</span></h3><p><span>A <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/primitives/transaction.h#L61\">Transaction Input</a> is a structure that comprises of a <em>hash key</em>, an <em>index number</em>, <em>signature script length </em>indicator, the <em>response script,</em>\u00a0and an <em>input sequence number</em>.</span></p><p/><p><span>The first two values, <strong>hash key</strong> and <strong>index number</strong>, are being used together to uniquely identify some previous output we want to redeem in our own Transaction. As we\u2019ve already approached hashes in the previous article, and also have used them to uniquely identify our blocks, the question here is: <em>Why do we need hashes and index numbers within transactions</em>? Let\u2019s look at the structure of Transactions in the picture below:</span></p><p><a href=\"http://blog.brakmic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/transaction_inputs_outputs-1.png\" class=\"grouped_elements\" rel=\"tc-fancybox-group1466\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1478\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-src=\"http://blog.brakmic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/transaction_inputs_outputs-1.png\" alt=\"\" data-srcset=\"http://blog.brakmic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/transaction_inputs_outputs-1.png 877w, http://blog.brakmic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/transaction_inputs_outputs-1-300x238.png 300w, http://blog.brakmic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/transaction_inputs_outputs-1-768x609.png 768w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 877px) 100vw, 877px\"/></a></p><p><span>As we can easily recognize a <span><strong>Transaction hash key</strong></span> alone wouldn\u2019t be precise enough to select the correct input BTC within a certain transaction. A collection of outputs within a Transaction mostly contains many entries, so we have to point at the right<span><strong> index number</strong></span> within. In the above picture we see a single entry in the left box but there could be hundreds of them. In the right box we see the Transaction input collection that points back to the previous Transaction output collection by selecting one of its entries by using an index number. This is how we create new Transactions:\u00a0</span></p><p><span>a) Refer to a previous Transaction by using its <strong>Hash Key</strong> (<strong><span>green</span></strong>)</span></p><p><span>b) Redeem certain Bitcoins by using <strong>index number</strong>(s) to point to one or more entries that belong to previous\u2019 Transaction output collection (<strong><span>red</span></strong>)</span></p><p><span>c) Create a <strong>new entry in your own Transaction input collection</strong> (this effectively makes incoming BTCs\u00a0<em>available to you</em>, because you can now create <em>new entries</em> in your own Transaction outputs)</span></p><p><span>We remember, <em>Bitcoin thinks in transactions only</em> and the above process is the way how Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain moves BTC from one address to another. Before you can spend any Satoshi you must first point to it in any of the previous transactions and deliver <em>a proof that you\u2019re its owner</em>.\u00a0</span></p><h3>Ownership</h3><p><span>Now that we\u2019ve learned how a certain BTC can be found on the blockchain the next question that comes to mind is: <em>How do we safely store and redeem our BTCs</em>? </span></p><p><span>The answer lies in the entries from the above structure I deliberately avoided to describe: <em>Public Key Script</em>, <em>Response Script</em>, and their<em> length indicators</em>. Each time one claims to be the owner of some BTC a certain script will be executed to check if the claimant can provide needed signatures to redeem and/or spend those BTC. And following the nature of Bitcoin this too is done via Transactions only. This is the reason why transaction inputs &amp; outputs contain certain scripts. However, they don\u2019t get executed like those scripts from our operating systems, for example. Blockchain scripts aren\u2019t shell-scripts or Batch-files. Quite the opposite. <em>Input and output scripts must be executed pairwise</em>. This is because every output script imposes a <em>certain challenge</em> to be <em>solved</em> by its input counterpart. </span></p><p><span>Described in a more simplistic terms, an <strong>output script</strong>\u00a0defines a <em>challenge</em>: \u201c<em>this 1BTC belongs to anyone who is in possession of a private key that can generate this signature I\u2019m carrying with me</em>\u201c. On the other side, the input script would solve this challenge by executing its own script-part thus generating data for comparison. Therefore, the BTC claimed in any input script can be taken from an output script by providing a solution to a certain challenge. We could describe Blockchain as a chain of back-linked blocks that supports a flow of values chained together by back-linked challenge/response scripts.\u00a0\u00a0</span></p><p><a href=\"http://blog.brakmic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/input_output_scripts.png\" class=\"grouped_elements\" rel=\"tc-fancybox-group1466\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1482\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-src=\"http://blog.brakmic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/input_output_scripts.png\" alt=\"\" data-srcset=\"http://blog.brakmic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/input_output_scripts.png 783w, http://blog.brakmic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/input_output_scripts-300x211.png 300w, http://blog.brakmic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/input_output_scripts-768x540.png 768w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 783px) 100vw, 783px\"/></a></p><h3>Script</h3><p><span>However, we\u2019re not done yet as there\u2019s something else that must be used to process those scripts: <a href=\"https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script\"><strong>Bitcoin\u2019s Scripting Language</strong></a> itself. Yes, it\u2019s true, Bitcoin has it\u2019s own scripting language. It actually has no specific name, so everyone calls it simply \u201cScript\u201d. It is a programming language but not like the most of those in use today. It\u2019s not a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness\">turing-complete language</a> which means that you can\u2019t write programs or arbitrary complexity, for example those that contain <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow#Loops\">loops</a>. The inventor of Bitcoin, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto\">Satoshi Nakamoto</a>, didn\u2019t want Bitcoin to rely on a language that could be (mis)used to execute any kinds of programs. Just imagine a script containing a never ending <em>for-loop</em>\u00a0thus effectively postponing all other operations on the Blockchain to some later date around the end of the known Universe. <em>Bye, bye Bitcoin</em>! </span></p><p><span>Therefore, certain powerful concepts, like loops, have been deliberately excluded from Script\u2019s design. However, do not think that Script is a \u201ccrippled\u201d language incapable of doing anything meaningful. It\u2019s actually very flexible one as it comprises of several powerful commands for fast signature evaluation, de/encryption, verification and so on. We won\u2019t be discussing Script in this installment as it deserves an article on its own. What\u2019s important to know is that during each transaction a certain amount of logic (a <em>program</em>) gets evaluated by using a scripting engine that runs on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain.</span></p><h3>Coinbase Transactions</h3><p><span>So, after having learned about transactions and how we can move Bitcoins from address to address the whole Blockchain \u201cstuff\u201d should be no problem for you anymore, isn\u2019t it? Well, one thing is missing and this is the<em> actual creation of bitcoins</em>? Where do bitcoins come from? Is there any \u201cprimal transaction\u201d that has created all bitcoins in the past? Well, the answer is no. Bitcoins have not been pre-generated in some distant past, but they continuously get created by <em>mining new Blocks</em>. Each and every Block contains a special transaction called <strong>Coinbase Transaction</strong> whose sole purpose is <em>to generate new bitcoins</em> without resorting to some previous output Transaction entry. Unlike \u201cnormal\u201d transactions that contain certain challenge scripts that have to be solved by response scripts, those new bitcoins come out of nothing and therefore have never had any previous \u201cholders\u201d. </span></p><p><span>Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain needs new blocks<em> to stay alive</em>. But those blocks don\u2019t get generated because \u201cit\u2019s funny\u201d to create them, or because Bitcoin is some nice \u201csocial network\u201d that everyone wants to participate in. Bitcoin and it\u2019s blockchain constitute a <strong>real business</strong> that generates billions of dollars/euros/whatever-fiat. And these days we need lots and lots of computing power to mine new blocks. Certain entities, mostly big companies, who are capable of producing and/or installing specialized hardware for mining blocks, want to be rewarded for their work. And their rewards are those new bitcoins from Coinbase Transactions. Therefore, whenever a new block gets mined the miner who has created this block will add a special transaction and assign a certain amount of bitcoins to him/herself. This is the reward for the miner who has taken care of including our transactions, executing our scripts, and forwarding our bitcoins from address to address. This whole process is vital for Bitcoin to exist. Without mining no blocks can be created and without proper rewards no one would want to mine Blocks in the first place. Therefore, think of BTCs in Coinbase transactions as <em>incentives to create blocks</em>. Because every miner wants to be the one who inserts its own address into the <em>Coinbase Transaction Output</em> the competition keeps the system alive. </span></p><p><span>Bitcoin users want to move their bitcoins around and miners want to get fresh bitcoins. And not only coinbase BTCs, because miners also get a certain share of BTCs for each transaction they put into new Blocks. This is called a \u201ctransaction fee\u201d. All in all, Bitcoin is not only a technology, but also a <em>social contract</em> that comprises of certain entities and incentives.</span></p><p/><p><span>Now the first question regarding the above code would be: <em>Why does the Coinbase Transaction contain Hash and Output Index values if there\u2019s no need to redeem some previous output BTCs</em>? The answer is simple: The values are the same for all Coinbase transactions.

The answer is: I<em>t depends</em>. There is a <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/chainparams.cpp#L77\">hard-coded rule</a> that controls the current mining subsidy. Every 21000 Blocks, or roughly 4 years, the subsidy halves. At the beginning of Bitcoin, in 2009, the subsidy was 50BTC per Block. It then halved in 2012 to 25BTC. Currently, the subsidy is 12,5BTC per Block. </span></p><p><span>Additionally, the miner assigns a certain amount of transaction fees collected from the transactions included in this block. The whole sum is what miners expect to get when mining new blocks. This is how bitcoins come into existence. And the maximum amount of all bitcoins that can be created will be slightly less than <a href=\"https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Controlled_supply\">21.000.000</a>.\u00a0</span></p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p><span>I hope that the whole process of creating Transactions, moving BTC around, and mining Blocks is now a little bit clearer. I know, the technique behind is complex and not that easy to explain, so we can only consume it bit by bit.

Is it enough to study the brain\u2019s machinery, or are we missing its larger design?</p>\n<p data-reactid=\"102\">Scholars have pondered the mind since Aristotle, and scientists have studied the nervous system since the mid-1800s, but neuroscience as we recognize it today did not coalesce as a distinct study until the early 1960s. In the first ever Annual Review of Neuroscience, the editors recalled that in the years immediately after World War II, scientists felt a \u201cgrowing appreciation that few things are more important than understanding how the nervous system controls behavior.\u201d This \u201cgrowing appreciation\u201d brought together researchers scattered across many well-established fields \u2013 anatomy, physiology, pharmacology, psychology, medicine, behavior \u2013 and united them in the newly coined discipline of neuroscience.</p>\n<p data-reactid=\"104\">It was clear to those researchers that studying the nervous system needed knowledge and techniques from many other disciplines. The <a href=\"http://museum.mit.edu/150/113\" target=\"_blank\" data-reactid=\"106\">Neuroscience</a><a href=\"http://museum.mit.edu/150/113\" target=\"_blank\" data-reactid=\"107\"> Research Program</a> at MIT, established in 1962, brought together scientists from multiple universities in an attempt to bridge neuroscience with biology, immunology, genetics, molecular biology, chemistry, and physics. The first ever Department of Neurobiology was <a href=\"http://neuro.hms.harvard.edu/about-us/history\" target=\"_blank\" data-reactid=\"109\">established</a> at Harvard in 1966 under the direction of six professors: a physician, two neurophysiologists, two neuroanatomists, and a biochemist. The first meeting of the Society for Neuroscience was held the next year, where scientists from diverse fields met to discuss and debate nervous systems and behavior, using any method they thought relevant or optimal.</p>\n<p data-reactid=\"112\">These pioneers of neuroscience sought to understand the relationship between the nervous system and behavior. But what exactly is behavior? Does the nervous system actually control behavior? And when can we say that we are really \u201cunderstanding\u201d anything?<br data-reactid=\"114\"/>\n<strong data-reactid=\"116\">Behavioral questions</strong><br data-reactid=\"117\"/>\nIt may sound pedantic or philosophical to worry about definitions of \u201cbehavior,\u201d \u201ccontrol,\u201d and \u201cunderstanding.\u201d But for a field as young and diverse as neuroscience, dismissing these foundational discussions can cause a great deal of confusion, which in turn can bog down progress for years, if not decades. Unfortunately for today\u2019s neuroscientists, we rarely talk about the assumptions that underlie our research.</p>\n<aside class=\"pullquote\" data-reactid=\"120\">\n<blockquote data-reactid=\"122\"><p data-reactid=\"123\">By these definitions, we don\u2019t currently \u201cunderstand\u201d the\u00a0brain</p></blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p data-reactid=\"126\">\u201cUnderstanding,\u201d for instance, means different things to different people. For an engineer, to understand something is to be able to build it; for a physicist, to understand something is to be able to create a mathematical model that can predict it. By these definitions, we don\u2019t currently \u201cunderstand\u201d the brain \u2013 and it\u2019s unclear what kind of detective work might solve that mystery.</p>\n<p data-reactid=\"128\">Many neuroscientists believe that the detective work consists of two main parts: describing in great detail the molecular bits and pieces of the brain, and causing a reliable change in behavior by changing something about those bits and pieces. From this perspective, behavior is an easily observable phenomena \u2013 one that can be used as a measurement.</p>\n<p data-reactid=\"130\">But since the beginning of neuroscience, a vocal and persistent minority has argued that detective work of this kind, no matter how detailed, cannot bring us closer to \u201cunderstanding\u201d the relationship between the nervous system and behavior. The dominant, granular view of neuroscience contains several problematic assumptions about behavior, the dissenters say, in an argument most recently made earlier this year by John Krakauer, Asif Ghazanfar, Alex Gomez-Marin, Malcolm MacIver, and David Poeppel in a <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28182904\" target=\"_blank\" data-reactid=\"132\">paper</a> called \u201cNeuroscience Needs Behavior: Correcting a Reductionist Bias.\u201d</p>\n<p data-reactid=\"135\">These authors argue that if we want to understand the relationship between brains and behavior, it would clearly be better to study both: the parts of nervous systems as well as the natural behaviors that shaped its evolution and development \u2013 the behaviors that helped make the nervous system in the first place. Most neuroscience today places a premium on extremely detailed recordings of the smaller components of nervous systems, such as tagging proteins on cell membranes to better photograph single neurons, or building tiny assemblies of metal pins to measure the electrical activity in a region of the brain. Unfortunately, as the authors note, much less value has been placed on the rigorous and detailed study of behavior. Why is there so little interest in nurturing the study of behavior, and such intense interest in detailing the nervous system?</p>\n<p data-reactid=\"137\">The authors suspect a twofold problem: relationships are difficult to study, and technology seems more rewarding in the short term. Understanding the relationship between nervous systems and behavior is undeniably hard. Progress can be slow and challenging to evaluate. On the other hand, exciting advanced technology has made it possible to study the components of brains in unprecedented detail. Technical advances come quickly and with clear, data-based measurements, but their methods often favor simple, data-driven verification questions over knotty, more conceptual questions about behavior.</p>\n<aside class=\"pullquote\" data-reactid=\"139\">\n<blockquote data-reactid=\"141\"><p data-reactid=\"142\">Individual or even groups of neurons cannot see, feel, think, or behave, and yet neuroscientists often talk about them as if they\u00a0can</p></blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p data-reactid=\"145\">These speedy, seemingly clear rewards have convinced many neuroscientists that studying the properties and interactions of individual cells is the best path towards understanding the nervous system and behavior. But just because <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/news/neuroscientists-rethink-how-the-brain-recognizes-faces-1.22091\" target=\"_blank\" data-reactid=\"147\">certain neurons</a> in a monkey\u2019s brain change their electrical activity <a href=\"https://massivesci.com/articles/facial-recognition-patches-brain-macaque/\" target=\"_blank\" data-reactid=\"149\">when that monkey sees a face</a> doesn\u2019t mean that those neurons can \u201crecognize\u201d a face. They are just one tiny part of the process that the whole monkey uses to recognize faces. In other words, scientists can sometimes forget that \u201cthe whole is greater than the sum of its parts,\u201d and that a brain is just part of a human being, not unlike a stomach or a heart. Individual or even groups of neurons cannot see, feel, think, or behave, and yet neuroscientists often talk about them as if they can.<br data-reactid=\"151\"/>\n<strong data-reactid=\"153\">The pull of \u2018publish or perish\u2019</strong><br data-reactid=\"154\"/>\nThe siren call of technology isn\u2019t the only reason why this narrow view of neuroscience seems attractive to researchers. Society, too, creates incentives for researchers to limit their projects. For one, a great deal of money is tied up in developing the technology behind neuroscience tools, and money makes experiments go round. Scientists understandably <a href=\"https://massivesci.com/articles/science-correction-pains-compounds/\" target=\"_blank\" data-reactid=\"156\">can\u2019t ignore the politics</a> around money.</p>\n<p data-reactid=\"159\">Additionally, neuroscience PhD programs have too often become a race to publish as many times as possible, in all the \u201ccorrect\u201d places and with all the \u201cright\u201d people. In order to survive in academia, neuroscientists often have to pass the particular muster of journal editors, who frequently reject behavioral studies for \u201cnot having enough neuro,\u201d as <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/02/how-brain-scientists-forgot-that-brains-have-owners/517599/\" target=\"_blank\" data-reactid=\"161\">Ghazanfar said in a recent interview</a>, \u201cas if every paper needs to be a methodological decathlon in order to be considered important.\u201d</p>\n<p data-reactid=\"164\">Addressing these points will require a great deal of change, both in science and in society, and history again provides some clues for how we might be better detectives.<br data-reactid=\"166\"/>\n<strong data-reactid=\"168\">Body as a sensor</strong><br data-reactid=\"169\"/>\nIn 1973, psychologist and control theory engineer William T. Powers argued that instead of assuming that brains control behavior based on sensory stimuli, it makes more sense to assume that brains adapt behavior to control what stimuli it gets from the world. Put another way, if we consider \u201cthe body\u201d (a.k.a. all of our parts that aren\u2019t the nervous system) to be the brain\u2019s sensors, then \u201cthe behavior\u201d that we see is the brain moving its sensors so that it can get the input it wants.</p>\n<p data-reactid=\"172\">For instance, when we wish to cross the street, we turn our head so that our eyes can look for any oncoming traffic; when we\u2019re in a conversation with a quiet talker, we lean our bodies in and direct our ears towards the speaker to better hear their words. In all these situations, we have a goal, and we move our bodies in order to get the sensory input that lets us achieve our goal.</p>\n<p data-reactid=\"174\">Powers\u2019 framework grants that there can be movements without a purpose, but for a movement to be considered behavior it must have a purpose. Thus if we want to study behavior, we need a way to distinguish between behavior and all possible movements. How can we do this?<br data-reactid=\"176\"/>\n<strong data-reactid=\"178\">A new way forward</strong><br data-reactid=\"179\"/>\nThis is where the study of animals, moving freely in their ecological niches, becomes crucial to validate any neuroscientific study of behavior. While we can safely assume that one of the goals of every living creature is to not die, we know from our own experience as humans that survival alone is hardly satisfying: we want, in addition to not dying, to feel safe, healthy, productive, fulfilled.</p>\n<p data-reactid=\"182\">Why do factors as subjective as our preferences matter in the quest to understand the nervous system? Powers emphasized that any theory or model of the nervous system must be consistent with our subjective experience of living with one. Thus, detailed descriptions of these two factors \u2013 our subjective life experiences, and the behaviors of free humans and animals \u2013 are just as important as detailed descriptions of nervous systems, because they teach us about the goals of the brain under our study, and thus allow us to pick out behaviors from movements.</p>\n<aside class=\"pullquote\" data-reactid=\"184\">\n<blockquote data-reactid=\"186\"><p data-reactid=\"187\">If we are trying to understand the relationship between thing A (nervous systems) and thing B (behavior), we would do well to study both things with close\u00a0detail.</p></blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p data-reactid=\"190\">Neuroscience isn\u2019t entirely lacking in the kind of detective work that Powers advocates. Neurologist <a href=\"http://www.radiolab.org/story/remembering-oliver-sacks/\" target=\"_blank\" data-reactid=\"192\">Oliver Sacks</a>\u2019 meticulous notes on his neurological patients\u2019 case histories revealed extraordinary insights into some of the most puzzling aspects of brain function, such as <a href=\"https://www.painscience.com/articles/sixth-sense.php\" target=\"_blank\" data-reactid=\"194\">proprioception</a> (knowing where your body parts are without having to look at them), <a href=\"https://www.aphasia.org/stories/happy-birthday-oliver-sacks/\" target=\"_blank\" data-reactid=\"196\">aphasia</a> (the inability to comprehend or express thoughts through language), and <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2010/12/03/131785460/Oliver-Sacks-Discusses-Vision-and-The-Mind-s-Eye\" target=\"_blank\" data-reactid=\"198\">blindsight</a> (the ability to respond to visual stimuli without consciously seeing). Many of Sacks\u2019 patients were referred to him after they were deemed too difficult to diagnose by other methods. Another example is zoologist Konrad Lorenz\u2019s extensive use of photography and film to research the evolution of behavior. He used <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqZmW7uIPW4\" target=\"_blank\" data-reactid=\"200\">these</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqZmW7uIPW4\" target=\"_blank\" data-reactid=\"202\">films</a> not just for analyzing behavior but also to share his observations more fully while teaching or giving talks; if a picture is worth a thousand words, a film can convey things that escape verbal description.</p>\n<p data-reactid=\"205\">More of this kind of detective work is urgently needed. The stark differences in how different neuroscientists understand behavior causes enormous confusion and frustration, especially among incoming PhD students. In the current training of neuroscientists, most PhD programs do not discuss the history or goals of modern academic neuroscience. But if we are trying to understand the relationship between thing A (nervous systems) and thing B (behavior), we would do well to study both things with close detail. And if we don\u2019t want to be hindered by potentially false assumptions, we need to be clear about proposed relationships, because that very first assumption will decide exactly what we label as \u201cdata\u201d versus \u201cnoise\u201d.</p>\n<p class=\"oembed\" data-reactid=\"207\"/>\n<p data-reactid=\"209\"><strong data-reactid=\"210\">Lessons from history</strong><br data-reactid=\"211\"/>\nThe past shows us where neuroscience has been and how we can move forward. We first assumed that nervous systems control behavior, then realized flaws in that framework. If the nervous system is just driving behavior, the way a person can drive a car, then studying the parts of the person won\u2019t explain how the car works, or why the person is driving in a particular direction. This idea also recalls the endlessly regressive <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homunculus_argument\" target=\"_blank\" data-reactid=\"213\">homunculus argument</a>, where the hard questions \u2013 \u201chow does this behavior happen?\u201d \u2013 are delayed by creating one black box inside another, one mystery just beyond the grasp of the one right in front of you.</p>\n<p data-reactid=\"216\">Perhaps it\u2019s time for neuroscience to try out a new paradigm. Even if there is no doubt that neuroscience needs sophisticated technological tools, we need equally sophisticated models of how the many parts of nervous systems work together to make our movements serve specific goals. Already, we can sometimes become lost in the struggle to interpret the sea of data delivered by our tools. It\u2019s time to turn toward new models of the nervous system based on an adjusted set of assumptions.<br data-reactid=\"218\"/>\n<strong data-reactid=\"220\">Peer Commentary</strong><br data-reactid=\"221\"/>\nWe asked other neuroscientists to respond with some commentary to this article. In a very small way, this is how peer-review works in scientific journals. We wanted to give you a taste of what scientific discussion looks like! If you want to know more, feel free to contact the scientists directly via Twitter.</p>\n<p data-reactid=\"224\"><a href=\"https://massivesci.com/people/benjamin-bell/\" target=\"_blank\" data-reactid=\"225\">Benjamin Bell</a>: This is a really interesting walk through the foundations of neuroscience. But I somewhat disagree with one of the authors\u2019 main assertions, where they claim that researchers focus primarily on the molecular components of the nervous system at the cost of a careful analysis of behavior.</p>\n<p data-reactid=\"228\">In my experience, much of modern neuroscience actually works off the behavioral model: researchers carefully study a specific behavior in a model animal and then perturb certain regions or components of its brain and observe the effects on behavior. Just for an example, basically the entire field of sleep research is based on this model.</p>\n<p data-reactid=\"230\">Still, I do agree with the authors that this still takes the shape of a reductionist approach. In order to really understand the relationships between neural mechanisms and behavior, we have to carefully examine only one small aspect of a behavior in the lab. But in nature, this action would be many times more complex and involve much more functionality than we are equipped to measure currently. I fully agree that reductionism in the lab is losing the forest for the trees, but I suspect in order to truly understand the brain, we will need to first break it down into the smallest of cause-effect components possible, and only afterwards we can begin to understand the larger frameworks of the mind.</p>\n<blockquote data-reactid=\"232\"><p data-reactid=\"233\">Kim responds: We\u2019re not saying manipulating the brain is not useful, only that we should know what our assumptions are.</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote data-reactid=\"235\"><p data-reactid=\"236\">We are concerned with the assumption that changes in behavior are caused by perturbing certain regions/components of the brain, which implies that the brain doesn\u2019t respond and change when an external force perturbs it. This perspective on behavior doesn\u2019t account for what we know about the evolution and development of the nervous system, in particular phenomena such as neuroplasticity.</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote data-reactid=\"238\"><p data-reactid=\"239\">The current \u201cbehavioral\u201d methods try to assign \u201cfunction\u201d to circuits by assuming those circuits are fixed and rigid, but this is actually a very important difference between nervous systems and computers, our current favorite analogy for the brain. We now know that nervous systems change and adapt their own structure and physiology all the time. If our goal is to understand behavior by manipulating neural circuits, we need to be much more strict about the assumptions underlying our manipulations, because we aren\u2019t the only ones making manipulations -- the nervous system is also making manipulations on itself.</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote data-reactid=\"241\"><p data-reactid=\"242\">I completely agree that if \u201cbehavior\u201d means any movement output of the organism, studying behavior in the wild would be entirely intractable. We believe that behaviors are movements that serve a purpose for the organism, and the defining aspect of a behavior is not the specific motor output but the goal.</p></blockquote>\n</div>\n</div></body></html>"}, "15429423": {"score": 2, "comments": ["Hello - yes we do.

The head of the social networking service\u2019s tooling shared a few learned lessons along the way.</em></p>\n<p>Reading and reviewing code is something every engineer does on a daily basis. A formal code review process, however, is a bit different \u2014 it requires every code change to be officially reviewed by another team member before the code goes to production. At LinkedIn, code reviews have been a mandatory part of our development process since 2011. Our goal in requiring code reviews was to scale our rapidly-growing engineering team as smoothly as possible. Good code reviews with meaningful, useful comments can really help with leveling up an entire engineering organization. At LinkedIn, these reviews have become an essential part of quality assurance and knowledge sharing. Embracing code reviews has changed our whole engineering culture for the better in several key ways.</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/szczepiq/\" class=\"clearfix infoBlock\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"infoBlockTextBlock\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"infoBlockTitle\">Szczepan Faber</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"infoBlockText\">Since 2015, Szczepan Faber has been a Tech Lead for LinkedIn Development Tools, the team responsible for tools and workflows that ensure engineering productivity. From 2011-2015, he was core engineer of Gradle 1.x and 2.x., a leading build and automation framework. Szczepan created Mockito framework in 2007, one of the most popular Java libraries, with an estimated user base of 2 million.</p>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</a>\n<p>One of the biggest benefits of implementing company-wide code reviews has been increased standardization in our development workflow. Every team at LinkedIn uses the same tools and process for doing code reviews, which means that anyone can help with reviewing or contributing code for another team\u2019s project. This eliminates problems like \u201cI could fix the bug in their code, but how would I build that code and submit the fix?\u201d This, in turn, helps increase collaboration across different teams in the engineering organization.</p>\n<p>By making code reviews a mandatory process, we\u2019ve also helped foster a healthy feedback culture at the company: engineers are open to giving and receiving feedback in all areas of work, not just in coding because it\u2019s become a routine component of the job. Rather than viewing code reviews as critical or negative, our engineers use both giving and receiving code reviews as opportunities to grow professionally. In fact, high-quality code reviews are an important part of LinkedIn\u2019s promotion process because they provide objective evidence of engineering skill.</p>\n<p>Over the years, we\u2019ve honed several best practices and tips for how to give truly great reviews. Below are some guidelines, in the form of questions, that we suggest asking to help make sure the reviewer and reviewee are getting the most value possible out of a code review.</p>\n<h3>Do I Understand the \u201cWhy\u201d?</h3>\n<p>To facilitate the best review possible and help your team scale, every code change submission should include a design overview that briefly explains the motivation behind the change. It is really hard to offer a high-quality code review when the rationale needs to be inferred from the code change itself. It is fair to ask and expect the submitter to explain their motivation before attempting the code review. This also encourages the submitter to have an explanation in their commit message, increasing the quality of code documentation.</p>\n<h3>Am I Giving Positive Feedback?</h3>\n<p>In an organization full of smart people, clean code and neat test coverage can be taken for granted. As a result, code review feedback tends to focus only on problems and issues found in the code. This is very unfortunate because most people need positive feedback to feel engaged and motivated \u2014 and engineers are no exception. When a reviewer sees good stuff in the code, they should call it out and give positive feedback. This helps improve team dynamics, and often such positive feedback is contagious. As with all code review comments (more on this below), any positive feedback should be specific, explaining why that particular code is well-written.</p>\n<h3>Is My Code Review Comment Explained Well?</h3>\n<p>Whether the feedback is positive or negative, any code review comment should be self-explanatory. What might seem obvious to the reviewer can be unclear to an engineer who receives poorly-explained code review comments. When in doubt, it is better to over-explain than to provide terse feedback that yields more questions and the need for more back-and-forth communication. Explanations can be as simple as \u201creduces duplication,\u201d \u201cimproves coverage,\u201d or \u201cmakes code easier to test.\u201d In addition to making reviewers\u2019 comments clearer, these types of explanations also help reinforce the design principles that the team aspires to meet.</p>\n<h3>Do I Appreciate the Submitter\u2019s Effort?</h3>\n<p>Hard work always needs to be appreciated, regardless of the outcome \u2014 this fosters strong, highly motivated teams. Some code changes are not of the highest quality and will need to be reworked. In those situations, it\u2019s important to still acknowledge the effort that the author put into the changes, even if their code needs reworking. The best way to show appreciation is to put effort into your code review by giving high-quality feedback with decent explanations, acknowledging the good ideas (there are always good things in every code submission!), and using \u201cthank you.\u201d</p>\n<h3>Would This Review Comment Be Useful to Me?</h3>\n<p>Asking this question is an easy and powerful way to validate if the code review comment is necessary. At the end of the day, engineers should view code reviews as helpful development tools, and not sources of unimportant busywork. If you don\u2019t think a particular review comment would be useful to you, then remove it. A classic example of unhelpful code review comments are ones related to code formatting. Code style and formatting should be validated by automated tools, not engineers.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/cdn.thenewstack.io/media/2017/09/efa28730-codereviews.png\" class=\"ext-image\" rel=\"external nofollow\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3155336\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/cdn.thenewstack.io/media/2017/09/efa28730-codereviews.png\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"3155336\" srcset=\"https://thenewstack.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/efa28730-codereviews.png 860w, https://storage.googleapis.com/cdn.thenewstack.io/media/2017/09/efa28730-codereviews-295x300.png 295w, https://storage.googleapis.com/cdn.thenewstack.io/media/2017/09/efa28730-codereviews-32x32.png 32w, https://storage.googleapis.com/cdn.thenewstack.io/media/2017/09/efa28730-codereviews-50x50.png 50w, https://storage.googleapis.com/cdn.thenewstack.io/media/2017/09/efa28730-codereviews-64x64.png 64w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 860px) 100vw, 860px\"/></a></p>\n<h3>Is the \u201cTesting Done\u201d Section Thorough Enough?</h3>\n<p>At LinkedIn, every code change submission has a mandatory \u201ctesting done\u201d section that needs to be filled out. In the open source world, using GitHub as an example, engineers can submit \u201ctesting done\u201d information in the pull request description. What should be in \u201ctesting done\u201d depends on the gravity of the changes and the current level of test coverage. If the change contains new or altered conditional complexity, it is fair to expect it to be covered in unit tests. Some changes may require running manual testing if the integration test coverage is inadequate. In those cases, \u201ctesting done\u201d should include information about the test scenarios and the outputs. When changes alter the output of the program, it is very useful to include the new output in the \u201ctesting done\u201d section.</p>\n<h3>Am I Too Pedantic in My Review?</h3>\n<p>Some code reviews have so many comments that important issues \u2014 ones that really need to be fixed \u2014 are lost among less important suggestions. Reviews that are too heavy on details for a given team can slow down the review cycle and cause friction for both the reviewers and reviewee. Having clear review expectations, example reviews, and a positive, inviting review culture are great ways to avoid lengthy, exhausting review cycles.</p>\n<p>In summary, having a formal code review process helps improve code quality, team learning, and knowledge sharing. The quality of work increases when every engineer on the team realizes two important things: someone else will read my code, so it better be good, and I\u2019ll have to address any review comments I receive, so I should try to make my code good the first time around to save myself effort later on. When code reviews become an everyday habit, the team practices giving and receiving feedback on a daily basis. This is key for growth and improvement.</p>\n<p>At LinkedIn, we\u2019ve learned a lot from the past one million code reviews, and we aspire to learn even more from the next million. The more effort that\u2019s put into code reviews, the better a team gets at giving great code reviews, the higher the quality of code that is checked in, and the higher the quality of the product that\u2019s built. High-quality code reviews are contagious!</p>\n<p><em>The author thanks James Miller, Oscar Bonilla, Joshua Olson, Andrew Macleod, Scott Meyer, and Deep Majumder for insightful feedback on this article.</em></p>\n<p class=\"attribution\">LinkedIn\u2019s parent company, Microsoft, is a sponsor of The New Stack.</p>\n<p class=\"attribution\">Feature image\u00a0by\u00a0<a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/VwFR0ruXR3g?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\" class=\"ext-link\" rel=\"external nofollow\">JJ Ying</a>\u00a0on\u00a0<a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\" class=\"ext-link\" rel=\"external nofollow\">Unsplash.</a></p>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div></body></html>"}, "15429892": {"score": 2, "comments": [], "time": "2017-10-08 23:39:38", "url": "https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/10/nasa-moon-mars/542340/?single_page=true", "text": "<html><body><div><div class=\"article-body\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">\n    \n        <p class=\"injector-promo-wrapper--article-top js-inject-promo\"/>\n        \n\n        <section id=\"article-section-1\"><p dir=\"ltr\">Rumors that the Trump administration was more interested in the moon than Mars began circulating days after the inauguration.

The Obama administration had maintained that some kind of human activity in cislunar space\u2014the region between the Earth and the moon\u2014was <a href=\"http://www.spaceflightinsider.com/organizations/nasa/nasa-human-spaceflight-plans-focus-announcement-deep-space-gateway\" data-omni-click=\"r'article',r'link',r'4',r'542340'\">necessary to test technology</a> for a mission to Mars, but the efforts would amount to a pit stop, not a destination.

NASA also wouldn\u2019t be starting from scratch. The space agency has spent the last decade building the Space-Launch System and Orion, a rocket and spacecraft intended to carry people into deep space but also to build a cislunar way station called the Deep-Space Gateway.

Boeing is currently developing a capsule that would ferry people into low-Earth orbit, and SpaceX said its proposed mega-rocket, which is mostly intended to fulfill Elon Musk\u2019s Sim City-esque ambitions for Mars, could contribute to travel to the moon. Musk, well aware of the political benefits of it, leaned heavily into lunar ambitions. \u201cIt\u2019s 2017.

The space agency has also been buoyed by interest from a general public bombarded with Hollywood movies about Mars and deep-space travel.</p><p>A renewed focus on the moon brings the United States into some alignment with space agencies in Europe, Russia, India, and China.

I want to tell you about such an app, and how it changed mine. I had nothing to do with its making; I have never installed or opened it on my phone; and yet, I expect that this will be the most personal of the almost 400 pieces I have written for TechCrunch over the years.</p>\n<p>It is estimated that between <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://americanpainsociety.org/about-us/press-room/nih-study-shows-prevalence-of-chronic-or-severe-pain-in-u-s-adults\" rel=\"noopener\">one-third and one-half</a> of adults in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/news/20110629/100-million-americans-have-chronic-pain\" rel=\"noopener\">United States</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/jun/20/silent-epidemic-of-chronic-pain-affects-nearly-28-million-in-uk-study-suggests\" rel=\"noopener\">United Kingdom</a> suffer from a chronic pain condition, a third of whom \u2014 i.e. tens of millions \u2014 are moderately or severely disabled by it. Those stunning numbers help to explain why, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/data/prescribing.html\" rel=\"noopener\">according to the CDC</a>, \u201csales of prescription opioids in the U.S. nearly quadrupled from 1999 to 2014\u201d \u2014 but to no avail \u2014 \u201cthere has not been an overall change in the amount of pain Americans report.\u201d</p>\n<p>My wife was, until recently, among that number. She suffered from chronic migraine, a.k.a. 15 or more migraine days every single month, a condition which affects roughly 1% of the population. In her case it came on several years ago, gradually but unstoppably. And while modern medications can work wonders on migraines, this is only true up to a point; after circa 10 medication days per month, migraine meds begin to trigger increasingly vicious migraines themselves, a bitterly ironic phenomenon known as \u201cmedication overuse headache.\u201d</p>\n<p>Those who do not suffer from migraines may not appreciate the extent to which they are far worse than just crippling headaches. A migraine is, rather, as a friend and Harvard professor of epidemiology once put it, \u201clike a slow-motion seizure.\u201d They can and do cause nausea, aphasia, wrenching serotonin crashes, brain fog, holes in one\u2019s field of vision. They can and do reduce you to a shadow of yourself.</p>\n<p>When you suffer from 18-20 migraine days per month, even though they are of varying severity, and even though you can medicate on half of those days, you essentially become disabled. Keeping up with her job as an attorney consumed effectively all of my wife\u2019s available <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoon_theory\" rel=\"noopener\">spoons</a>. Her life shrank to her work, our home, and very occasional outings; and those outings were inevitably tense and fraught with anxiety for both of us, because when you live with chronic migraine, you never know exactly what might trigger one, but you do know that migraine triggers are absolutely fucking everywhere.</p>\n<p>She gave up alcohol. She gave up sugar. She gave up caffeine. She gave up running. She gave up travel, one of her great loves, except when absolutely necessary, because air travel was a reliable migraine trigger, and long car rides weren\u2019t great either. She gave up staying up late. She gave up naps. We became frequent fliers at urgent care clinics and ERs. We consulted with some of the world\u2019s finest migraine specialists. They were wonderful, but they didn\u2019t cure her.</p>\n<p>She tried dozens of prescription medications. She tried Botox. She tried steroids. She tried meditation. She tried an IUD. She tried transcranial magnetic stimulation. She tried everything. She took a fistful of supplements and preventatives every day. She spent a week in a hospital with a port in her arm, getting twice daily infusions of powerful medication. Some of these things seemed to diminish the average severity of her migraines, a little bit; but none diminished their frequency.</p>\n<p>It seems that for a lot of people, including my wife, once a migraine gets going, once that vicious death spiral of cascading neurochemicals has begun, there is no way out. (Relatedly, most anti-migraine medications need to be taken early on in the onset of an attack, or they are useless.) She had tried everything, and nothing seemed to stop them. At least once a month she would be hit by a three-day intractable migraine impervious to every medication, and would spend 72 hours in darkness, shuddering with agony, fighting nausea, eking out a precious few minutes of half-relief from heat or ice packs every now and again, gutting it out for what felt every time like an eternity.</p>\n<p>To be honest we gave up even hoping that her condition might be curable. Migraine is a hereditary disorder, and while hers were the most severe, her sisters, mother, aunts, and cousins are all migraineurs too. I barely dared to hope that the next generation of anti-migraine medications, emerging in the next few years, might reduce her migraines by as many as five days per month. Hope is a real motherfucker, in a situation like this, with a chronic pain condition like this. Hope is always ready to turn around and kick you right in the teeth.</p>\n<p>I promised you this was an article about an app. This is probably a good time to start talking about that.</p>\n<p>The app is, appropriately, called <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.curablehealth.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">Curable</a>. Its treatment program is based on the (thoroughly scientifically grounded) notion that chronic pain tends to slowly rewire the brain to \u201cperpetuate the feeling of pain\u201d \u2014 and that this neurological sensitization to pain can be undone, in whole or in part, via mindfulness and cognitive behavioral therapy. Its founder and CEO, John Gribbin, fought lower back pain for fifteen years himself before overcoming it with this technique.</p>\n<p>It may sound odd that cognitive techniques can overcome and eliminate real physical pain, but there is an sizable amount of hard science behind this, which Curable users are walked through. Lest you think this is a goofy fringe approach, the Mayo Clinic offers a similar <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://intheloop.mayoclinic.org/2017/08/03/from-no-hope-to-relief-from-long-term-pain/\" rel=\"noopener\">multidisciplinary pain program</a>, wherein \u201cchronic pain, unlike the acute variety, [is] treated as a malfunction in perception, whether or not an ongoing physical cause [has] been identified\u201d (7) \u2026 for $40,000 (not to mention an extended stay in Arizona, Florida or Minnesota). Curable, by contrast, is free at first, and ultimately charges all of $5 a month.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t want to pretend that it will be a panacea for every chronic pain sufferer. It won\u2019t. But I can tell you that in the two months since my wife started using it, she has gone from 18-20 migraine days a month to one or two. Yes, you read that correctly. She has resumed drinking wine, eating chocolate, running and lifting weights, napping, casually booking cross-country &amp; transcontinental flights, and working long, strenuous attorney hours again. We have an appointment with her neurologist later this month \u2026 for a friendly dinner, because it doesn\u2019t look like we\u2019ll be needing his professional services much anytime soon.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve read a lot of scientific studies about migraine and pain treatments over the last few years. I\u2019m well aware that most of them have a subset of \u201csuper responders\u201d for whom the results are especially dramatic. I know that not everyone who tries Curable will be as fortunate as my wife.</p>\n<p>But Curable is the first attempt I\u2019ve seen to take modern chronic pain treatment, wherein the pain is treated as a reversible consequence of neurological sensitization, and make it easily and readily available to the teeming, thronging, overwhelming masses of people who are suffering; and while I\u2019m obviously heavily biased from my own experience with it, I can\u2019t help but think that an enormous number of them could benefit hugely.</p>\n\n\n<small>Featured Image: Thom Lang/Getty Images</small>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div></body></html>"}, "15430408": {"score": 3, "comments": [], "time": "2017-10-09 01:35:26", "url": "https://abe-winter.github.io/squares/2017/10/07/snap.html", "text": "<html><body><div><div class=\"post-content\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">\n    \n\n\n\n<p>Facebook in its history was very briefly cool, and then mom dad &amp; grandma signed up to ruin it.</p>\n\n<p>Snapchat if it survives will stay cool for longer because adults really don\u2019t get it.

Every teenager has something to hide. For the new generation of digital native teens it\u2019s worse, because they\u2019re carrying multiple generations of bad trends on their shoulders:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>trading outside play for TV time in the 70s</li>\n  <li>soccer / minivan helicopter parenting of the 90s</li>\n  <li>being digital natives forces them to live in public if they want to have a life</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>They have smartphones instead of cars, they use drugs &amp; have sex later<sup id=\"fnref:sex-drugs-cars\"><a href=\"#fn:sex-drugs-cars\" class=\"footnote\">1</a></sup>, they\u2019re alone more of the time.</p>\n\n<p>And institutional overreach is exposing the new generation of teens to some serious shit. An appeals court in 09 was totally okay with a principal strip-searching a 13 year-old<sup id=\"fnref:safford-school-v-redding\"><a href=\"#fn:safford-school-v-redding\" class=\"footnote\">2</a></sup>. They ruled that it\u2019s probably illegal but the principal can\u2019t be expected to know that.</p>\n\n<p>In 2015 an appeals court upheld the suspension of a student for making, off-campus, a violent rap video<sup id=\"fnref:bell-v-itawamba\"><a href=\"#fn:bell-v-itawamba\" class=\"footnote\">3</a></sup>. The facts of the case are horrible:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Bell wrote the rap because of a pattern of sexual harrassment of students by coaches.</li>\n  <li>At a school board hearing, he was faulted for protesting in public rather than through official channels</li>\n  <li>The majority ruled that facebook / youtube speech shared with the school community is \u2018on-campus speech\u2019 and subject to school discipline</li>\n  <li>The opinion is worth a read for its overview of 1st amendment issues at school, for the shocked &amp; upset dissent, and for fun drop-ins like \u2018BONG HiTS 4 JESUS\u2019</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The majority quotes another ruling saying:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>with near-constant student access to social networking sites  on  and  off campus,  when  offensive  and  malicious  speech  is  directed  at  school officials and disseminated online to the student body, it is reasonable to anticipate an impact on the classroom environment</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Their conflation of \u2018offensive\u2019 and \u2018malicious\u2019 attacks speech contrary to the interests of the institution, not speech that harms anybody. If this argument stands it rolls back decades of pro-speech law.</p>\n\n<p>These cases are the reality of institutional education &amp; parenting in this generation. Teenagers have great incentive to be careful about who hears them. The squares have it in for us.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"teenagers--tradecraft\">Teenagers &amp; tradecraft</h2>\n\n<p>One of danah boyd\u2019s research areas is how teens partition their digital accounts. Teens wouldn\u2019t engage in this kind of labor-intensive tradecraft if they didn\u2019t care about who knows what about them. From an interview:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>That\u2019s one of the things that teenagers struggle with about Facebook: how to deal with multiple contexts simultaneously. Usually we address context collapse using alcohol in face-to-face environments, like at weddings. Online we don\u2019t have that, so we have to deal with a lot of awkwardness. So of course people are going to have multiple identities.<sup id=\"fnref:boyd\"><a href=\"#fn:boyd\" class=\"footnote\">4</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Is it important to distinguish between snapchat\u2019s ephemeral features and its instagram-like photo-stream features? I think no. Both are incomprehensible to adults. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgqTufBiTEU\">South Park explains what youth culture sounds like to adults</a>. It\u2019s not strange for youth culture to be passed from person to person furtively in dark allies and under bridges. Novelty and secrecy are inherently linked \u2013 new technology binds to new culture and then becomes associated with youth economics and politics, and then has to stay even more secret. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpTSVy3yzts\">Mose Allison probably agrees with me</a>.</p>\n\n<p>While I was writing this, a 90s startup known for mailing out floppy disks<sup id=\"fnref:floppy\"><a href=\"#fn:floppy\" class=\"footnote\">5</a></sup> retired their AIM chat service<sup id=\"fnref:aim\"><a href=\"#fn:aim\" class=\"footnote\">6</a></sup>. But the generation of kids who grew up with AIM &amp; SMS brought it with them as they joined the workforce and immortalized their round-robin, attention-deficit communication style in the form of Slack. (I still don\u2019t understand chat at work. In my opinion Slack is a tool for letting your worst performers disable your best performers. Ugh).</p>\n\n<p>We can expect history to repeat itself \u2013 the next generation will bring snapchat expectations to the workplace and shape their workdays &amp; careers around privacy-awareness, decentralization and ephemeral communication. I know email storage is a legal issue; the kids will find a way around it. The law will mutate to meet their needs.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"adults-with-teenager-like-needs\">Adults with teenager-like needs</h2>\n\n<p>In lots of places adults have a teenager-like need for privacy because their countries or communities are run by squares (and I guess some are legit criminals).</p>\n\n<p>Unmarried people in gulf states, for example:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>private communication channels available on social-media networks help foster meaningful relationships</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If caught engaging in unsanctioned romance, people \u2014 especially women \u2014 face social stigma and harsh punishment from families. They must also contend with religious police, who monitor not only malls and coffeehouses but also online forums.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Ahmad al-Ghamdi, a former chief of the religious police in the city of Mecca, said the force feels threatened by social media because \u201cit makes it harder to supervise people.\u201d He said he resigned from his position in protest of abuses committed by members of the religious police, which is tasked with enforcing Islamic law. Many Saudis say the religious police have increasingly resorted to sting operations, blackmail and beatings in public.<sup id=\"fnref:saudi-adults\"><a href=\"#fn:saudi-adults\" class=\"footnote\">7</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>British people, who at last count:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Can be arrested for not giving up their password<sup id=\"fnref:british-password\"><a href=\"#fn:british-password\" class=\"footnote\">8</a></sup> (sans warrant, of course).

Privacy has for a long time been a defense against that but digital social platforms are often public by default. When squares can\u2019t attack private citizens for their behavior, they go after art \u2013 if you can spare 1:12:05 check out the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d65BxvSNa2o\">PMRC hearings</a>, that time in 1985 when the senate brought in famous musicians to testify about \u2018tipper stickers\u2019 on audio CDs.</p>\n\n<p>Circa 18:10 Dee Snider (twisted sister) says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>songs allow a person to put their own imagination experiences and dreams into the lyrics. \u2026 Ms Gore was looking for sadomachism and bondage and she found it</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Al Gore responds \u201cyap\u201d and looks pissed. But you should really watch the whole thing.</p>\n\n<p>Journalists and whistle-blowers have teenager-esque needs for secrecy; their work is seldom clearly illegal but often subject to overreach by government and business interests who have privacy needs of their own. Edward Snowden thought he had to teach tradecraft to Laura Poitras before involving her and was conceivably right.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"china\">China</h2>\n\n<p>Speaking of squares \u2026</p>\n\n<p>The chinese are working on \u2018social credit\u2019, a system of lightweight disincentives to \u2018gateway drug\u2019 behavior \u2013 for example, lowering someone\u2019s score for playing too many hours of video games because of the perception that gaming makes people unproductive citizens. As originally proposed it addresses both sides of the social contract: reduce corruption in government, reduce laziness and waste in workers.</p>\n\n<p>It hasn\u2019t been implemented yet but they talk about it a lot. It\u2019s not clear what the system would do. Here\u2019s what is clear:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>The part that affects private citizens is getting more PR effort than the part that affects government officials</li>\n  <li>Implementing this will require significant opt-in from digital services \u2013 certainly ISPs, probably also platform operators</li>\n  <li>The demerits would be linked to some kind of institutional disincentive \u2013 probably not jail, probably something like access to college, money, jobs, migration.</li>\n  <li>I haven\u2019t heard anyone describe an experimental framework for identifying <em>which</em> behaviors are harmful to society. I think they\u2019ll be picking rules out of a hat.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This is disasteful to me, but beyond that, I wonder if it\u2019s something that will backfire. If they don\u2019t carefully study the effects of their incentives, they risk severing hidden behavioral links. What if startup founders are all avid gamers? What if future leaders get their start by chatting with dissidents online?</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-fringes\">The fringes</h2>\n\n<p>Creativity comes from the fringes of society and law. Not just art, but the new ideas that keep business competitive. Many societies have experimented with cracking down on fringe groups in order to provide stability and this technically works. Rigid norms &amp; obstacles to mobility can protect the status quo for a while. Caste systems are great at protecting from internal change. But when you provide obstacles to gradual internal change, you slow your ability to innovate &amp; compete, and leave yourself open to violent change from outside.</p>\n\n<p>Some archaeologists think native americans used controlled burns to maintain ecotones, transitional areas between ecosystems, in order to increase the density of food resources<sup id=\"fnref:ecotones\"><a href=\"#fn:ecotones\" class=\"footnote\">13</a></sup>. Eliminating diversity and fringe groups from your society seems like the opposite of this. I\u2019m stretching the metaphor, but people think that wildfires are worse in western forests because managers won\u2019t permit \u2018healthy burns\u2019 to go out on their own. Only you can prevent forest fires, but <em>should</em> you?</p>\n\n<p>My point isn\u2019t to say censorship restrains free association (it obviously does). My point is that platform censorship is one of the forces driving people to decentralized networks &amp; ephemeral messaging. In Hong Kong people are using mesh networks to enable protests.<sup id=\"fnref:hk-mesh\"><a href=\"#fn:hk-mesh\" class=\"footnote\">14</a></sup> The Chinese can censor their internet platforms to prevent free association<sup id=\"fnref:criticism-vs-association\"><a href=\"#fn:criticism-vs-association\" class=\"footnote\">15</a></sup>, they can crack down on anonymity<sup id=\"fnref:anonymity-spring\"><a href=\"#fn:anonymity-spring\" class=\"footnote\">16</a></sup> through platforms and ISPs, but the effect won\u2019t be to eliminate activism \u2013 they\u2019re fertilizing the ground for decentralized communication tech.</p>\n\n<p>The Arab Spring didn\u2019t happen because of the internet. It just started there. Squares don\u2019t get the difference. A real name policy won\u2019t ensure a stable user base in the PRC any more than it will on FB.</p>\n\n<p>Most importantly, remember that to a teenager, mom &amp; dad and the 50-cent party are the same. Which means Chinese activists and helicoptered digital teens will be looking for the same set of tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Governments want to rebuild the web as a policing tool and rebuild the fourth amendment to exclude the web. They want backdoors in everything, reduced warrant requirements, and self-policing and censorship by platform operators. They want platform activity linked to your national ID.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s easy to read all this as an intentional project to arm governments for tyranny. Instead, I think police leaders are optimizing a single variable \u2013 efficiency of policing. They just want to make current police activities cheap &amp; automatic. Judges are pushing back but not as much as they should. Legislators are mostly indifferent.</p>\n\n<p>Ten years ago social networks seemed ripe for enabling disruption and social change because they make it easy to recruit &amp; communicate with like minded people. It turns out they also make it easy for status quo powers to disrupt revolutions. It\u2019s not even a wash \u2013 in the end police &amp; squares gain more from the web than revolutionaries, because it enables them to reclassify private sphere behavior as public purely by virtue of the fact that it\u2019s visible to them.</p>\n\n<p>In Bowers v Hardwick, the alabama sodomy case from the 80s, Blackmun\u2019s dissent turned on privacy. Would it still be private if the defendants arranged to meet using FB?</p>\n\n<p>In Lawrence v Texas, the case that overturned Bowers, the arresting officer was responding to a malicious tip about a violent intruder and when no intruder was found, he called a DA to find out if he could make an arrest for having sex in a residence. You can interpret this as moral outrage, or as a square testing his boundaries.</p>\n\n<p>Like all institutions, the state &amp; police care about their mission second and power first. With or without malice, regulators are letting squares take the web. Squares don\u2019t need mens rea to do harm. Soon <em>nobody</em> will have nothing to hide.</p>\n\n<p>When your country censors wikipedia, the internet just a tool for social surveillance &amp; ads. At that point let\u2019s shut it down. When the internet becomes useful as a policing tool it will cease to be useful for anything else. Platforms (hello FB) are already eroding the shared web as a permanent archive for information<sup id=\"fnref:fireball\"><a href=\"#fn:fireball\" class=\"footnote\">17</a></sup>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"get-ready-for-sneakernet\">Get ready for sneakernet</h2>\n\n<p>Snapchat is the cargo cult of a decentralized internet. Next is the prod version.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re looking for \u2018today\u2019 solutions to this problem, decentralize your web use. Run your own email server, move off facebook, host your blog, access the internet via more different connections: VPNs, tor, whatever. Centralization is easy to attack. It\u2019s more costly and less rewarding to attack 10 subtly different platforms than one big one.</p>\n\n<p>As snapchat commercializes post-IPO we\u2019ll see teenagers and college students decamp to legitimately decentralized media.</p>\n\n<p>The \u2018dark web\u2019 will grow: people sometimes use this to mean websites not surfaced on google and sometimes to mean <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">.onion</code> domains on secret service directories served over tor. Both will matter more in the near future.</p>\n\n<p>If internet privacy tracks its descent, and regulations create liabilities that outweight the benefits of being connected, the next generation of decentralized media will be:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Distributed digitally but not via networks \u2013 teens (and other private people) will exchange it peer to peer to avoid tracking and censorship</li>\n  <li>Interactive and risky \u2013 there will be a continuum between text, video and games. Computer viruses will spread on the same vectors as STDs (the risky teens trying them first).</li>\n  <li>In places where the internet is locked down, there will be bootleggers helping to distribute</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This can be a good thing. When information is universal it\u2019s necessarily shallow.

Sames goes for the serverConfig</p>\n<p>The changed parts of the file looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code>const clientConfig = (tenant) =&gt; ({\n  ...config,\n\n  name: 'client',\n  target: 'web',\n\n  entry: {\n    client: ['babel-polyfill', `./src/tenants/${tenant}/client.js`],\n  },\n  .\n  .\n  .\n  .\n  .\n\nconst serverConfig = tenant =&gt; ({\n  ...config,\n\n  name: 'server',\n  target: 'node',\n\n  entry: {\n    server: ['babel-polyfill', `./src/tenants/${tenant}/server.js`],\n  },\n  .\n  .\n  .\n  .\n  export default [clientConfig, serverConfig];\n\n  export function createTenantConfig(tenant) {\n    return [clientConfig(tenant), serverConfig(tenant)];\n  }\n</code></pre>\n<p>Make sure to add <code>()</code> around the <em>clientConfig</em> and <em>serverConfig</em> Objects, so that it is not interpreted as the function body.</p>\n<p>Now that we can pass in the tenant, we need to create a new script under <code>tools/</code> that will bundle our files with the correct tenant.</p>\n<p>Create <code>tools/bundleTenantA.js</code> and add this code:</p>\n<pre><code>import webpack from 'webpack';\nimport webpackConfig, {createTenantConfig} from './webpack.config';\n\n/**\n * Creates application bundles from the source files.\n */\nfunction bundle() {\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {\n    webpack(createTenantConfig('a')).run((err, stats) =&gt; {\n      if (err) {\n        return reject(err);\n      }\n\n      console.info(stats.toString(webpackConfig[0].stats)); return resolve();\n    });\n  });\n}\n\nexport default bundle;\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is very similar to <code>bundle.js</code> but with the extra import for creating our tenant specific config and the call of it.</p>\n<p>Now we can finally add a new task to <code>package.json</code>. Just follow the example of all the other tasks and add</p>\n<pre><code>\"bundle:tenanta\": \"babel-node tools/run bundleTenantA\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>Bundling for our tenant is now almost working :)</p>\n<h2 id=\"developingtenanta\">Developing Tenant a</h2>\n<p>In order to see our Tenant in the dev environment in the browser we need to create a new <em>start</em> task as well.</p>\n<p>First we update the <code>tools/start</code> script.</p>\n<p>On line 73 and 120 we use the createTenantConfig again, after we imported it, and change to start function to accept a parameter.</p>\n<p>Here are the changes:</p>\n<pre><code>import { createTenantConfig } from './webpack.config';\n.\n.\n.\nasync function start(tenant) {\n.\n.\n\nconst clientConfig = createTenantConfig(tenant).find(\n  config =&gt; config.name === 'client',\n);\n.\n.\n.\n\nconst serverConfig = createTenantConfig(tenant).find(\n  config =&gt; config.name === 'server',\n);\n  .\n  .\n  .\nconst multiCompiler = webpack(createTenantConfig(tenant));\n\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"creatingawrapperscript\">Creating a wrapper script</h3>\n<p>Now create a wrapper scripts at <code>tools/startTenantA.js</code>.<br/>\nThe code is easy and just executes the start script with the correct tenant.</p>\n<pre><code>\nimport start from './start';\n\nconst startTenantA = async () =&gt; start('a');\n\nexport default startTenantA;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now we just need to add this to the <code>package.json</code>, and we are ready to go:</p>\n<pre><code>\"start:tenanta\": \"babel-node tools/run startTenantA\",\n</code></pre>\n<p>Run <code>yarn start:tenanta</code> and you should be greeted by the starter site with <strong>Tenant</strong> <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"reapingthebenefits\">Reaping the benefits</h2>\n<p>Now you can repeat the steps to create a Tenant <strong>b</strong>. When you are done we can finally see why this approach is helpful when managing multiple tenants.</p>\n<h3 id=\"usingasharedcomponent\">Using a shared component</h3>\n<p>Update both <code>routes/home/Homes.js</code> like this:</p>\n<pre><code>import React from 'react';\nimport Shared from '../../../../SharedComponents/Shared';\n\nconst Tenant = () =&gt;\n  &lt;div&gt;\n    &lt;Shared /&gt;\n    &lt;h1&gt;Tenant &lt;/h1&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;;\n\nexport default Tenant;\n</code></pre>\n<p>and then create <code>src/SharedComponents/Shared.js</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>import React from 'react';\n\nexport default () =&gt; &lt;div&gt;SHARED&lt;/div&gt;;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now when you start the different tenants they will be using a shared component.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thebenefits\">The Benefits</h2>\n<p>Why use this approach and not f.e. put all shared components in a library?<br/>\nEasy, less problems. Whatever team works on this repo will know if something will break when they change a shared component, because they can run all the tests.<br/>\nAlso all teams will see the PRs.</p>\n<p>If you really need to add some behaviour to a component that no one else needs?

Between 1910 and 1915, the pioneering American geneticist Thomas Hunt Morgan worked on <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em> in his renowned Fly Room at Columbia University and showed that genes provide the basis for chromosomal heredity, for which he won a Nobel prize. It was a critical breakthrough, but there was no particular reason that it had to be made via the fruit fly. Yet ever since then, the tiny drosophila has been at the forefront of genetic research. In the 1920s, another American geneticist, Hermann J Muller, demonstrated that radiation leads to genetic mutation in fruit flies.

When Ashburner started out in the 1970s, flies were kept in milk bottles in a temporary lab on the outskirts of Cambridge.

It takes about six months to master the minute motor skills necessary to do the job.</p>\n<p>\u201cUsually half the embryos will survive that procedure,\u201d says Collier. \u201cAnd we can breed from them and study them.\u201d</p>\n<p>But study what exactly? And to what end?</p>\n<p>Collier introduces me to two colleagues who are active in fruit fly research, a reader in genetics called Cahir O\u2019Kane and Damian Crowther, a director of neuroscience research and development at the pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca, who still retains links to the Fly Facility.</p>\n<p>We go out to lunch and talk fruit flies. I ask Crowther first of all why he left academic research to go into industry.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe story I tell,\u201d he says, \u201cis friends, and perhaps even enemies, would always introduce me as, \u2018This is Damian, he\u2019s the fly guy\u2019. In my time, I\u2019ve been a registrar in neurology and a research scientist in many areas \u2013 I didn\u2019t think fly guy really summed me up.\u201d</p>\n<p>O\u2019Kane echoes the point and both men agree that fly research has not brought them either the professional or social recognition they believe their work warrants.</p>\n<p>What seems to matter most, in terms of professional appreciation at least, is what is known as \u201ctranslation\u201d, that is, turning the findings of fly research into productive contributions to medical applications for humans. There is little doubt that fly research does contribute, in a wider sense of biological understanding of how all organisms work, but also in specific examples of human disease. However, it\u2019s not easy to make direct links.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s problematic, for obvious reasons, to go from fly tests to human tests; there usually needs to be a whole range of intervening stages in which other scientists take over and, inevitably, take the spotlight and accreditation.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you that there\u2019s a drug that I\u2019ve tested on fruit flies [with an artificially created version of Alzheimer\u2019s disease] that\u2019s benefited the fruit fly that\u2019s then gone on to benefit the human,\u201d says Crowther.</p>\n<p>But, he explains, Alzheimer\u2019s involves the overproduction of proteins that form plaque in the brain that destroys neurons. \u201cSo you can make models of flies that produce these proteins, get their own plaque and die,\u201d he explains, \u201cand you can then test various ways of preventing the plaque formations.\u201d</p>\n<p>Fruit flies don\u2019t naturally develop Alzheimer\u2019s, although they have all the genetics of the Alzheimer\u2019s pathway in their brain.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have to give them human equivalent genes and push it really hard to get them to have Alzheimer\u2019s in three weeks,\u201d explains Crowther.</p>\n<figure itemprop=\"associatedMedia image\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\" data-component=\"image\" class=\"element element-image img--landscape  fig--narrow-caption fig--has-shares \" data-media-id=\"6b69a5635b3faac5150e25c31912a3ae20c8cf67\" id=\"img-5\">\n<meta itemprop=\"url\" content=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b69a5635b3faac5150e25c31912a3ae20c8cf67/0_0_3867_2404/master/3867.jpg?w=700&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=f2943ea58b32e8c952fdece20e21a5cc\"/>\n<meta itemprop=\"width\" content=\"3867\"/>\n<meta itemprop=\"height\" content=\"2404\"/>\n<a href=\"#img-5\" class=\"article__img-container js-gallerythumbs\" data-link-name=\"Launch Article Lightbox\" data-is-ajax=\"\">\n <span class=\"inline-expand-image inline-icon centered-icon rounded-icon article__fullscreen modern-visible\">\n<svg viewbox=\"0 0 22 22\" class=\"centered-icon__svg rounded-icon__svg article__fullscreen__svg modern-visible__svg inline-expand-image__svg inline-icon__svg\">\n<path d=\"M3.4 20.2L9 14.5 7.5 13l-5.7 5.6L1 14H0v7.5l.5.5H8v-1l-4.6-.8M18.7 1.9L13 7.6 14.4 9l5.7-5.7.5 4.7h1.2V.6l-.5-.5H14v1.2l4.7.6\"/>\n</svg> </span> </a>\n\n<figcaption class=\"caption caption--img caption caption--img\" itemprop=\"description\">\n<span class=\"inline-information inline-icon reveal-caption-icon centered-icon rounded-icon\">\n<svg viewbox=\"0 0 6 14\" class=\"reveal-caption-icon__svg centered-icon__svg rounded-icon__svg inline-information__svg inline-icon__svg\">\n<path d=\"M4.6 12l-.4 1.4c-.7.2-1.9.6-3 .6-.7 0-1.2-.2-1.2-.9 0-.2 0-.3.1-.5l2-6.7H.7l.4-1.5 4.2-.6h.2L3 12h1.6zm-.3-9.2c-.9 0-1.4-.5-1.4-1.3C2.9.5 3.7 0 4.6 0 5.4 0 6 .5 6 1.3c0 1-.8 1.5-1.7 1.5z\"/>\n</svg> </span> Life cycle stages of the fruit fly, Drosophila sp, showing larva, pupa, adult male (dark abdomen) and adult female.

He believes that because it\u2019s so cheap, it should be used in a multiplicity of ways that might point the direction to more productive lines of research. And where there are drugs that have already been tested on humans and have passed safety requirements but have failed in their efficacy with the targeted complaint, they could be retargeted by first testing them on flies.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe thinking around really bad diseases like motor neurone disease, Huntington\u2019s disease, is if you can get anything to work in a cell culture replicated in an organism, that\u2019s the beginning \u2013 as long as it\u2019s safe \u2013 of quickly getting it to patients,\u201d says Crowther.</p>\n<p>O\u2019Kane is particularly suspicious of overblown claims for translation. For him, the beauty of the fruit fly is that it is a organism that rewards study in a larger context.</p>\n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail element-rich-link--not-upgraded\" data-component=\"rich-link\" data-link-name=\"rich-link-2 | 2\">\n<div class=\"rich-link\">\n<div class=\"rich-link__container\">\n<p class=\"rich-link__header\">\n<h1 class=\"rich-link__title\">Can the humble fruit fly help create a flourishing African scientific community?</h1>\n</p>\n\n<a class=\"rich-link__link u-faux-block-link__overlay\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/aug/20/fruit-fly-african-scientific-research-kampala\"/>\n</div>\n</div>\n</aside>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m interested in it because I think it\u2019s a great system for finding out how living things in general can work. I think by understanding the principles of how flies work then you can make better predictions for humans. The better you understand how we work the more rational you can be about trying to design therapies; I think even without directing your work towards therapy, then you can think more intelligently about therapies five or 10 years down the line.\u201d</p>\n<p>It has been said, not least by Collier, that more is known about the biology of the drosophila than any other animal on Earth. For instance, we know that fruit flies have a kind of built-in compass in their brains that enables a sense of direction. As all animals need to know how they move, it\u2019s not unreasonable to assume that it\u2019s a form of universal computation.</p>\n<p>Another study has shown that male fruit flies that are rejected by a female mate are more inclined to drown their sorrows in food spiked with alcohol than male fruit flies that had successfully mated. Again, a brain chemical that regulates the flies\u2019 appetite and is predictive of their thirst for alcohol has an equivalent that has been linked to alcohol consumption in humans.</p>\n<p>In another study, this time at Oxford, it was found that fruit flies are capable of what might be termed thoughtful deliberation. Rather than making purely impulsive decisions, they take time to react when presented with a difficult choice.</p>\n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\">\n<span class=\"inline-quote inline-icon inline-tone-fill\">\n<svg viewbox=\"0 0 33 20\" class=\"inline-tone-fill__svg inline-quote__svg inline-icon__svg\">\n<path d=\"M9.002 20c3.85.068 6.932-3.104 7-6.994.068-3.892-3.15-6.937-7-7.006-2.016-.036-3.59.694-4.888 2.053A9.968 9.968 0 0 1 4.001 6.5C4.064 2.97 7.414.937 11.003 1l-1-1C3.98 0 .098 4.447.002 10.006c-.097 5.557 3.35 9.892 9 9.994zm17 0c3.85.068 6.932-3.104 7-6.994.068-3.892-3.15-6.937-7-7.006-2.016-.036-3.59.694-4.888 2.053a9.968 9.968 0 0 1-.113-1.553c.063-3.53 3.413-5.563 7.002-5.5l-1-1c-6.022 0-9.904 4.447-10 10.006-.097 5.557 3.35 9.892 9 9.994z\"/>\n</svg> </span>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"pullquote-paragraph\">Obviously we're more sophisticated, because we're studying them, they're not studying us</p>\n</blockquote>\n<span class=\"inline-quote inline-icon closing inline-tone-fill\">\n<svg viewbox=\"0 0 33 20\" class=\"closing__svg inline-tone-fill__svg inline-quote__svg inline-icon__svg\">\n<path d=\"M9.002 20c3.85.068 6.932-3.104 7-6.994.068-3.892-3.15-6.937-7-7.006-2.016-.036-3.59.694-4.888 2.053A9.968 9.968 0 0 1 4.001 6.5C4.064 2.97 7.414.937 11.003 1l-1-1C3.98 0 .098 4.447.002 10.006c-.097 5.557 3.35 9.892 9 9.994zm17 0c3.85.068 6.932-3.104 7-6.994.068-3.892-3.15-6.937-7-7.006-2.016-.036-3.59.694-4.888 2.053a9.968 9.968 0 0 1-.113-1.553c.063-3.53 3.413-5.563 7.002-5.5l-1-1c-6.022 0-9.904 4.447-10 10.006-.097 5.557 3.35 9.892 9 9.994z\"/>\n</svg> </span>\n</aside>\n<p>In other words, once again their behaviour could be described as human-like. It seems that the common ingredient in both human and fly behaviour is a gene called FOXP, which is closely linked to cognitive development in humans. Flies with defective FOXP take longer to arrive at a decision, just as defects in the human type of FOXP have been correlated with low intelligence.</p>\n<p>It is this long and valuable history of study of the drosophila that should guarantee its continued involvement in genetic research. But much of what has been good about working with flies is now being replicated in human stem cell research, which has the added advantage of being species-relevant. This was the other reason why Crowther moved into the private sector: the competition from stem cells meant that he found it increasingly difficult to get fruit fly-based research funded.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe fly is yesterday\u2019s guy,\u201d he says, \u201cyesterday\u2019s technology. For me, stem cells are the next fruit fly.\u201d</p>\n<p>O\u2019Kane looks quite glum at the prospect and argues that there have been questions over the future of fruit fly research ever since he started his lab 25 years ago. But he maintains that the work he\u2019s done in hereditary spastic paraplegia would have taken 10 times longer to perform with mice. O\u2019Kane has grown to appreciate the rich biological and social development of fruit flies in the time he\u2019s been working with them.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe more you look at their behaviour,\u201d he says, \u201cthe more sophisticated you realise they are. Even in aggression, how a male fruit fly behaves in a fight will depend on his previous experience of fighting with other males and what the other males\u2019 previous experience of fighting is. It\u2019s amazing to think about all the machinery that\u2019s involved to be able to do that. Obviously we\u2019re more sophisticated, because we\u2019re studying them, they\u2019re not studying us.\u201d</p>\n<p>For the time being, until some over-ambitious genetics professor does manage to mutate into a fly, that\u2019s the way the relationship should continue. And both humans and fruit flies, it turns out, can drink to that.</p>\n</div>\n</div></body></html>"}, "15429333": {"score": 1, "comments": [], "time": "2017-10-08 21:33:41", "url": "http://www.fccj.or.jp/number-1-shimbun/item/576-on-my-watch.html", "text": "<html><body><div><div class=\"itemFullText\"> <p>\u00a0</p>&#13;\n<p><img alt=\"No1-2015-4Carsten\" src=\"http://www.fccj.or.jp/images/number1shimbun/2015April_photos/No1-2015-4Carsten.jpg\"/><span/></p>&#13;\n<p><span>Island hopping: The author on a South Korean junket to Takeshima that got him <br/>called into the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</span></p>&#13;\n<p><span>\u00a0</span></p>&#13;\n<p><span>Confessions of a foreign correspondent </span></p>&#13;\n<p><span>after a half-decade of reporting from Tokyo </span></p>&#13;\n<p><span>to his German readers</span></p>&#13;\n<p><a href=\"http://www.fccj.or.jp/number-1-shimbun/item/588-5.html\"><span>\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u8a33\u306f\u3053\u3061\u3089<br data-mce-bogus=\"1\"/></span></a></p>&#13;\n<p><br/></p>&#13;\n<p><strong><span>by Carsten Germis<br/></span></strong></p>&#13;\n<p class=\"dropcap\">M<span/></p>&#13;\n<p><span>y bags are packed, as the song goes. After more than five years as the Tokyo correspondent for the German daily, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, I will soon leave Tokyo for home. </span></p>&#13;\n<p><span>The country I\u2019m leaving is different from the one I arrived in back in January 2010. Although things seem the same on the surface, the social climate \u2013 that has increasingly influenced my work in the past 12 months \u2013 is slowly but noticeably changing.</span></p>&#13;\n<p><span>There is a growing gap between the perceptions of the Japanese elites and what is reported in the foreign media, and I worry that it could become a problem for journalists working here. Of course, Japan is a democracy with freedom of the press, and access to information is possible even for correspondents with poor Japanese language skills. But the gap exists because there is a clear shift that is taking place under the leadership of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe \u2013 a move by the right to whitewash history. It could become a problem because Japan\u2019s new elites have a hard time dealing with opposing views or criticism, which is very likely to continue in the foreign media.</span></p>&#13;\n<p><span>The Nikkei recently published an essay by their correspondent in Berlin about the February visit to Japan of German Chancellor Angela Merkel. He wrote: \u201cMerkel\u2019s visit to Japan was more conducive to criticism of Japan than friendship. With Japanese experts, she discussed her country\u2019s policy to end nuclear power. She talked about the wartime history when she visited the Asahi and when she met with Abe. She also talked with Katsuya Okada, president of the DPJ, the largest opposition party. . . . Friendship was promoted only when she visited a factory run by a German company and shook hands with the robot Asimo.\u201d</span></p>&#13;\n<p><span>\u00a0</span></p>&#13;\n<p><span>The country I\u2019m leaving is different </span></p>&#13;\n<p><span>from the one I arrived in </span></p>&#13;\n<p><span>back in January 2010. </span></p>&#13;\n<p><span>\u00a0</span></p>&#13;\n<p><span>That seemed harsh. But, even accepting the premise . . . what is friendship? Is friendship simply agreement? Is not true friendship the ability to speak of one\u2019s beliefs when a friend is shifting in a direction that could cause him harm? And surely Merkel\u2019s visit was more complex than just critical.</span></p>&#13;\n<p><span>Let me make my own stance clear. After five years, my love and affection for this country are unbroken. In fact, thanks to the many fine people I\u2019ve met, my feelings are stronger than ever. Most of my Japanese friends and Japanese readers in Germany have told me they feel my love in my writing, especially following the events of March 11, 2011. </span></p>&#13;\n<p><span>Unfortunately, the bureaucrats at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA) in Tokyo see things completely differently, and it seems some in the Japanese media feel the same way. To them I have been \u2013 like almost all my German media colleagues \u2013 a Japan basher capable of only delivering harsh criticism. It is we who have been responsible for, as the Nikkei\u2019s man in Berlin put it, the two countries\u2019 bilateral relations becoming \u201cless friendly.\u201d</span></p>&#13;\n<p><span>\u00a0</span></p>&#13;\n<p><span><strong>Changing relations</strong></span></p>&#13;\n<p><span>The <em>Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung</em> is politically conservative, economically liberal and market oriented. And yet, those claiming that the coverage of Abe\u2019s historical revisionism has always been critical are right. In Germany it is inconceivable for liberal democrats to deny responsibility for what were wars of aggression. If Japan\u2019s popularity in Germany has suffered, it is not due to the media coverage, but to Germany\u2019s repugnance at historical revisionism.<br/><br/></span></p>&#13;\n<p class=\"dropcap\">My tenure in Japan began with very different issues. In 2010, the Democratic Party of Japan ran the government. All three administrations I covered \u2013 Hatoyama, Kan and Noda \u2013 tried to explain their policies to the foreign press, and we often heard politicians saying things like, \u201cWe know we have to do more and become better at running the country.\u201d</p>&#13;\n<p><span>Foreign journalists were often invited by then Deputy Prime Minister Katsuya Okada, for example, to exchange views. There were weekly meetings in the Kantei, the PM\u2019s residence, and officials were willing to discuss \u2013 more or less openly \u2013 current issues. We didn\u2019t hesitate to criticize the government\u2019s stance on certain issues, but officials continued to try to make their positions understood.</span></p>&#13;\n<p><span>The rollback came soon after the December 2012 elections. Despite the prime minister\u2019s embrace of new media like Facebook, for example, there is no evidence of an appreciation for openness anywhere in his administration. Finance Minister Taro Aso has never tried to talk to foreign journalists or to provide a response to questions about the massive government debt. </span></p>&#13;\n<p><span>In fact, there is a long list of issues that foreign correspondents want to hear officialdom address: energy policy, the risks of Abenomics, constitutional revision, opportunities for the younger generation, the depopulation of rural regions. But the willingness of government representatives to talk with the foreign press has been almost zero. Yet, at the same time, anyone who criticizes the brave new world being called for by the prime minister is called a Japan basher.</span></p>&#13;\n<p><span>\u00a0</span></p>&#13;\n<p><span>Anyone who criticizes the brave new world </span></p>&#13;\n<p><span>being called for by the prime minister </span></p>&#13;\n<p><span>is called a Japan basher.</span></p>&#13;\n<p><span>\u00a0</span></p>&#13;\n<p><span>What is new, and what seems unthinkable compared to five years ago, is being subjected to attacks from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs \u2013 not only direct ones, but ones directed at the paper\u2019s editorial staff in Germany. After the appearance of an article I had written that was critical of the Abe administration\u2019s historical revisionism, the paper\u2019s senior foreign policy editor was visited by the Japanese consul general of Frankfurt, who passed on objections from \u201cTokyo.\u201d The Chinese, he complained, had used it for anti-Japanese propaganda.</span></p>&#13;\n<p><span>\u00a0</span></p>&#13;\n<p>\u00a0</p>&#13;\n<p class=\"dropcap\">It got worse. Later on in the frosty, 90-minute meeting, the editor asked the consul general for information that would prove the facts in the article wrong, but to no avail. \u201cI am forced to begin to suspect that money is involved,\u201d said the diplomat, insulting me, the editor and the entire paper. Pulling out a folder of my clippings, he extended condolences for my need to write pro-China propaganda, since he understood that it was probably necessary for me to get my visa application approved.</p>&#13;\n<p><span>Me? A paid spy for Beijing? Not only have I never been there, but I\u2019ve never even applied for a visa. If this is the approach of the new administration\u2019s drive to make Japan\u2019s goals understood, there\u2019s a lot of work ahead. Of course, the pro-China accusations did not go over well with my editor, and I received the backing to continue with my reporting. If anything, the editing of my reports became sharper. </span></p>&#13;\n<p><span>The heavy handedness has been increasing over the past few years. In 2012, while the DPJ was still in power, I took a junket to South Korea, interviewing former comfort women and visiting the contested island of Takeshima (Dokdo to Koreans). Of course it was PR, but it was a rare chance to see the center of the controversy for myself. I was called in by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for a meal and discussion, and received a few dozen pages of information proving that the island was Japanese.</span></p>&#13;\n<p><span>\u00a0</span></p>&#13;\n<p><span>But things seem to have changed in 2014, </span></p>&#13;\n<p><span>and MoFA officials now seem to </span></p>&#13;\n<p><span>openly attack critical reporting.<br data-mce-bogus=\"1\"/></span></p>&#13;\n<p><span>\u00a0</span></p>&#13;\n<p><span>In 2013, with Abe\u2019s administration in charge, I was called in once again after I wrote about an interview with three comfort women. This also included a lunch invitation, and once again I received information to help my understanding of the prime minister\u2019s thoughts.</span></p>&#13;\n<p><span>But things seem to have changed in 2014, and MoFA officials now seem to openly attack critical reporting. I was called in after a story on the effect the prime minister\u2019s nationalism is having on trade with China. I told them that I had only quoted official statistics, and their rebuttal was that the numbers were wrong.</span></p>&#13;\n<p><span>\u00a0</span></p>&#13;\n<p><span><strong>My departing message</strong></span></p>&#13;\n<p><span>Two weeks before the epic meeting between the Consul general and my editor, I had another lunch with MoFA officials, in which protests were made of my use of words like \u201cwhitewash history,\u201d and the idea that Abe\u2019s nationalistic direction might \u201cisolate Japan, not only in East Asia.\u201d The tone was frostier and, rather than trying to explain and convince, their attitude was angrier. No one was listening to my attempts to explain why German media are especially sensitive about historical revisionism.</span></p>&#13;\n<p><span>I\u2019ve heard of an increase in the number of lunch invitations from government officials to foreign correspondents, and the increased budgets to spread Japanese views of World War II, and the new trend to invite the bosses of foreign correspondents deemed too critical (via business class, of course). But I would suggest the proponents tread carefully, since these editors have been treated to \u2013 and become inured to \u2013 political PR of the highest caliber and clumsy efforts tend to have an opposite effect. When I officially complained about the Consul\u2019s comments about my receiving funds from China, I was told that it was a \u201cmisunderstanding.\u201d<br/><br/></span></p>&#13;\n<p class=\"dropcap\">So here\u2019s my departing message: Unlike some of my colleagues, I do not see a threat in Japan to freedom of reporting. Though many critical voices are more silent than during the DPJ administration, they are there \u2013 and perhaps in larger numbers than before.</p>&#13;\n<p><span>The closed-shop mentality of the Japanese political elite and the present inability of the administration leaders to risk open discussion with foreign media doesn\u2019t really affect press freedom; there are plenty of other sources to gather information. But it does reveal how little the government understands that \u2013 in a democracy \u2013 policy must be explained to the public. And the world.</span></p>&#13;\n<p><span>It doesn\u2019t strike me as funny any more when colleagues tell me that the LDP doesn\u2019t have anyone in the press affairs department who will speak English or provide information to a foreign journalist. Nor does the fact that the present prime minister, who claims to be well traveled, has declined to make the short trip to speak to us at the Foreign Correspondents\u2019 Club. In fact, I can only be saddened at how the government is not only secretive with the foreign press, but with its own citizens.</span></p>&#13;\n<p><span>\u00a0</span></p>&#13;\n<p><span>It doesn't strike me as funny any more </span></p>&#13;\n<p><span>that the LDP doesn't have anyone in the press affairs </span></p>&#13;\n<p><span>department who will speak English.</span></p>&#13;\n<p><span>\u00a0</span></p>&#13;\n<p><span>In the past five years, I\u2019ve been up and down the Japanese archipelago, and \u2013 unlike in Tokyo \u2013 I\u2019ve never had anyone, from Hokkaido to Kyushu, accuse me of writings that were hostile to Japan. On the contrary, I\u2019ve been blessed with interesting stories and enjoyable people everywhere. Japan is still one of the most wealthy, open nations in the world; it\u2019s a pleasant place to live and report from for foreign correspondents. </span></p>&#13;\n<p><span>My hope is that foreign journalists \u2013 and even more importantly, the Japanese public \u2013 can continue to speak their minds.

In case of the GNM there simply is not enough exhibition space to showcase all 3500 of them at the same time. The CT digitalization project will enable us to create a virtual museum in which digital facsimiles of these instruments are available to anyone with internet access.\u201d</p> \n<p>The team has already digitalized more than a hundred instruments dating back over several centuries \u2013 from the baroque trumpet and the mouth harmonica to the square piano. Different types of CT systems are needed to scan different-sized instruments. The square piano, for example, is X-rayed utilizing a linear accelerator, which is the source of radiation in Europe\u2019s largest CT machine. The XXL X-ray environment consists of two eight-meter-tall steel scaffolding towers and a turntable with a diameter of three meters, housed in a hall covering a surface area of 400 square meters and rising to a height of 14 meters. Smaller string and wind instruments are X-rayed using conventional apparatus. For each test, the object is placed on a turntable between the X-ray source and typically a flat-panel detector, which produces images of very high spatial resolution. A specially designed holder keeps the instrument firmly in place while the X-ray beam penetrates the rotating object. The required dose of radiation varies according to the thickness and density of the material. Depending on the structure and condition of the instrument, the scanning process can take several hours, during which the CT system records several thousand images which are then stitched together to produce a three-dimensional view.</p> \n<p>The researchers aim to publish their results online by January 2018 at the latest. These will not only include the collected CT data but also detailed and comprehensible documentation of all steps in the measurement process. The examination standard defines the CT scanning parameters, and the accompanying set of guidelines provides advice on its application for different instruments.</p> \n<h4>Openly accessible metadata</h4> \n<p>Moreover, at the end of the project, all the technical parameters and metadata will be published in a database developed at the GNM. \u201cIdeally, we would like to be able to digitalize the museum\u2019s entire collection of historical musical instruments and place the 3D images online. Our examination standard defines the best way to go about this task,\u201d says Fuchs. \u201cOne of the many factors that we are now able to quantify is the time needed to digitalize different instruments. For example, a complete X-ray scan of a violin at a resolution of less than 50 microns takes up to 20 hours. This figure can be extrapolated to determine the time needed to scan an amount of x instruments. This produces a specific quantity of voluminous datasets, requiring corresponding amounts of hard disk and network capacity and special software. We have compiled a list of all these requirements.\u201d Another advantage of the standard is that it enables the know-<br/> ledge and experience gained from scanning musical instruments to be applied to other museum collections such as telescopes and other scientific instruments or old weapons.</p> \n<p>Visitors to the \u201cLong Night of Sciences\u201d event in F\u00fcrth on October 21 will have the opportunity to take a look inside numerous historical musical instruments. One of the exhibitions will include a presentation of CT images by Fraunhofer EZRT, selected from among those produced during the project.</p></div>\n        </div></body></html>"}, "15429410": {"score": 1, "comments": [], "time": "2017-10-08 21:57:37", "url": "http://awealthofcommonsense.com/2017/10/taking-financial-advice-from-a-lottery-winner/", "text": "<html><body><div><section class=\"entry-content clearfix\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-19627\" src=\"http://awealthofcommonsense.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-28-at-9.49.32-AM.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"http://awealthofcommonsense.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-28-at-9.49.32-AM.png 309w, http://awealthofcommonsense.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-28-at-9.49.32-AM-199x300.png 199w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 309px) 100vw, 309px\"/>\n<p>In a 2005 Powerball drawing a strange thing happened.</p>\n<p>There were 110 people who all picked the same exact lottery numbers \u2014 22, 28, 32, 33 and 39. This group picked 5 out of the 6 numbers correctly, good enough for the 2nd prize.</p>\n<p>Having 110 people pick the same numbers across 29 different states was quite rare, considering at most there were 4-5 people who would split the prize in the average drawing.</p>\n<p>Each winner was due to make six figures, making the total payout was $19 million higher than expected. This raised some eyebrows and caused people at the lottery association to look into how this could have happened. After ruling out fraud, they finally figured it out, as told by the New York Times:</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"242\" data-total-count=\"2100\"><em>\u201cOur first winner came in and said it was a fortune cookie,\u201d said Rebecca Paul, chief executive of the Tennessee Lottery. \u201cThe second winner came in and said it was a fortune cookie. The third winner came in and said it was a fortune cookie.\u201d</em></p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"287\" data-total-count=\"2387\"><em>Investigators visited dozens of Chinese restaurants, takeouts and buffets. Then they called fortune cookie distributors and learned that many different brands of fortune cookies come from the same Long Island City factory, which is owned by Wonton Food and churns out four million a day.</em></p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"162\" data-total-count=\"2549\"><em>\u201cThat\u2019s ours,\u201d said Derrick Wong, of Wonton Food, when shown a picture of a winner\u2019s cookie slip. \u201cThat\u2019s very nice, 110 people won the lottery from the numbers.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>If any of these 110 people worked in the investment business they probably would have started their own newsletter \u2014\u00a0<em>My Secret Formula for Winning the Lottery.</em></p>\n<p>I was reminded of this story while reading a New York Times profile on angel investor Jason Calacanis. Calacanis is worried about how technology is going to impact the jobs of millions of Americans and wants to help this group invest in tech to make up for it. His new book is called\u00a0<em>Angel: How to Invest in Technology Startups \u2014 Timeless Advice From An Angel Investor Who Turned $100,000 into $100,000,000.</em></p>\n<p>Here\u2019s the backstory on how he earned his $100 million:</p>\n<p><em>In 2009, the venture capital firm Sequoia\u00a0enlisted Mr. Calacanis as one of its \u201cscouts,\u201d\u00a0an informal network of entrepreneurs who look for promising companies on the firm\u2019s behalf. As part of that program, Mr. Calacanis invested $25,000 on a friend\u2019s crazy-sounding tech-enabled cab company. The friend was Travis Kalanick; the company was Uber. And despite that company\u2019s recent turmoil, the deal has turned into Mr. Calacanis\u2019s biggest win as an angel by far, worth about $100 million on paper.</em></p>\n<p>For those who are unaware, Sequoia Capital is one of the most well-known venture capital firms in the world. So while Calacanis took a huge right risk in this situation and hit the jackpot, I\u2019m not sure how much timeless advice 99.9% of investors can glean from someone who has contacts at one of the best VC firms in the world who made his fortune on a single home run investment.</p>\n<p>Even the best investors in venture capital have a hard time picking and choosing the right deals and investments. Most are complete failures. I know from experience how ultra-competitive this space is and it\u2019s only gotten more so in recent years. Even if you put in the time to educate yourself about angel investing it\u2019s one of the harder areas of the markets to invest successfully in because the opportunity set is so limited and hard to access.</p>\n<p>I have a <a href=\"http://awealthofcommonsense.com/2014/05/investing-hard-adam-sandler-edition/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">theory</a>\u00a0about comedians\u00a0that the more successful (read: wealthy) they become the less funny they become (Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David are probably the exceptions to this rule) because they lose touch with reality or begin to take themselves too seriously.</p>\n<p>This seems to apply to most uber-wealthy people who try to give financial advice to the average person as well.\u00a0I can appreciate successful people who would like to share with others what made them successful. But no amount of books, morning routines, meditation rituals or inspirational quotes are going to make you filthy rich. The circumstances are drastically different than people in the middle class are dealing with. And it\u2019s impossible to replicate luck.</p>\n<p>Obviously, this isn\u2019t always the case. Not all wealthy people are out of touch lottery winners. But people have to temper their expectations when trying to emulate the top 1% of the top 1%. You can be inspired by these people but following their blueprint for becoming wealthy is a different story.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ll give Calacanis the benefit of the doubt and assume he doesn\u2019t have ill intentions here. But most people are better off learning how to get their personal finances in order and investing in themselves than trying to find home run investments that will change their lives.</p>\n<p>Sources:<br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/11/nyregion/who-needs-giacomo-bet-on-the-fortune-cookie.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Who Needs Giacomo: Bet on the Fortune Cookie (NYT)</a><br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/27/technology/when-tech-disrupts-wealth-and-stability-angels-may-be-solution.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Should the Middle Class Invest in Risky Tech Start-Ups?

By the time your friend has finished explaining that as many as 12-million gallons of wine and brandy a year were once produced at Winehaven, you\u2019d realize that while you may be able to order a decent bottle of wine in a fancy restaurant, you don\u2019t know beans about California\u2019s wine history, especially before Prohibition.</p>\n<p>Few people do. In fact, if those who shop at BevMo for bargain bottles think about California\u2019s wine history at all, their timeline usually begins in 1976 at the so-called Judgment of Paris, in which a Stag\u2019s Leap Cabernet Sauvignon and a Chateau Montelena Chardonnay, both from the Napa Valley, stunned the international wine world by beating some of France\u2019s most esteemed Bordeaux and Burgundies in a blind tasting.</p>\n<p>To be sure, one would not directly credit the C.W.A. for the Judgment of Paris, but this watershed moment in California wine history didn\u2019t come out of nowhere. Or at least that was my reaction after reading a terrific new book called <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/1250033225/?tag=colleweekl-20\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Tangled Vines</em></a> by <a href=\"http://francesdinkelspiel.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Frances Dinkelspiel</a>. Even though the main thread of Dinkelspiel\u2019s narrative concerns the events leading up to an arson-caused warehouse fire in 2005, which destroyed 4.5 million bottles of wine worth at least a quarter-billion dollars, the story of the C.W.A.\u2014at one point, it controlled a staggering 84 percent of California\u2019s wine business\u2014figures prominently. What else might Dinkelspiel know about the C.W.A. that didn\u2019t make it into her book? My interest piqued, I decided to call her and find out.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn the 1890s, the California wine industry was a mess,\u201d Dinkelspiel told me when we spoke a few days later over the phone. The economic panic of 1893, she explained, had created a glut of grapes, severely depressing the price of fruit and wine alike. \u201cThe timing was right for someone to get in there and dominate the market in order to stabilize it,\u201d she says.</p>\n\n<p>Founded in San Francisco in 1894, the C.W.A. was comprised of a number of highly influential \u201csomeones,\u201d including the biggest and most successful wine merchants in the city, who had their hands in everything from the ownership of vineyards across the state to wineries and distributorships. By joining together to form the C.W.A., they were effectively colluding\u2014in broad daylight\u2014to create a wine cartel, despite the fact that the Sherman Antitrust Act had just passed in 1890. That\u2019s how bad things were for California grape growers and wine merchants in 1894; the prospect of an antitrust lawsuit brought by the federal government was preferable to the status quo.</p>\n<p>The main tactic of the newly formed C.W.A. was simple\u2014wait everyone out. As the biggest buyer of California grapes and biggest seller of finished product, the C.W.A. could force growers to accept the prices it was willing to pay, lest they get nothing before their fruit rotted. Similarly, if wine sellers in the Chicago, New Orleans, and New York didn\u2019t want to pay the prices the monopoly was demanding for its barrels and bottles of wine, the association could simply hold onto its inventory until the recalcitrant wine merchants had run out of theirs.</p>\n<p>Not surprisingly, such strong-arming did not sit well with growers, winemakers, and distributors not aligned with the C.W.A., which is why, by 1897, an all-out economic wine war was raging between the association and an upstart rival, the California Wine-Makers Corporation.</p>\n<p>Because of its size and deep pockets, the C.W.A. had the upper hand on the economic battlefield. Under the leadership of president Percy Morgan, the\u00a0association abandoned its 1893 tactics, which were designed to stabilize the wine market by holding the line on prices. Instead, it slashed the cost of its wine, undercutting Wine-Makers Corporation wineries. By 1900, that corporation\u2019s three most important members, including the Italian-Swiss Colony winery of Sonoma County, had raised the white flag and joined the C.W.A. At the turn of the 20th century, membership in the C.W.A. was apparently the only way for a big California winery to survive.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_65927\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"wp-image-65927 size-full\" src=\"https://d3h6k4kfl8m9p0.cloudfront.net/uploads/2015/12/10182044/CWA-Men-2.jpg\" alt=\"Two of California's most important wine figures at the end of the 19th century were Isaias Hellman (left) and Percy Morgan.\"/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Two of California\u2019s most important wine figures at the end of the 19th century were Isaias Hellman (left) and Percy Morgan.</p></div>\n<p>The resolution of this battle between the dueling cartels paved the way for an unprecedented $1 million investment\u00a0in the C.W.A. in 1901. The equivalent of around $28 million today, the funding infusion was led by an investment banker and Southern California vineyard owner named Isaias Hellman, who just so happens to be Dinkelspiel\u2019s great-great-grandfather.</p>\n<p>Even without the family connection, the C.W.A. would have found its way into <em>Tangled Vines</em>. But Dinkelspiel\u2019s page-turner had only whetted my appetite for details about the monopoly and the circumstances that led to its creation, so I called up wine writer and publisher <a href=\"http://www.gailunzelman.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Gail Unzelman</a>, whose <em><a href=\"http://www.nomispress.com/califwineassn.html\" target=\"_blank\">The California Wine Association and Its Member Wineries, 1894-1920</a></em>, co-authored with the late wine historian Ernest Peninou, is considered the definitive work on the subject.</p>\n<p>As a publisher of books via <a href=\"http://nomispress.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Nomis Press</a> and a respected wine quarterly called \u201c<a href=\"http://www.waywardtendrils.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Wayward Tendrils</a>,\u201d Unzelman has provided a platform for such esteemed wine writers and historians as Peninou, Thomas Pinney, and Charles Sullivan. As a collector for more than 40 years, she\u2019s filled binder upon binder with wine ephemera such as labels and wine-related postcards, as well as a wine library that now boasts some 4,000 titles, most of them focused on California\u2019s viticultural history.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think it\u2019s about 3,917,\u201d Unzelman corrects me when we speak. \u201cI\u2019m a very organized person, and I can still get through my house,\u201d she adds. \u201cIt\u2019s not like there\u2019s stuff in the hallway\u2014yet.\u201d</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_65928\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-65928 size-full\" src=\"https://d3h6k4kfl8m9p0.cloudfront.net/uploads/2015/12/10182116/Calwa10Million.jpg\" alt=\"The C.W.A.'s logo featured Bacchus, the god of wine, and a grizzly bear like the one on California's state flag.

(Courtesy Gail Unzelman)</p></div>\n<p>One of the cornerstones of Unzelman\u2019s book collection is a one-of-a-kind, handmade volume, which came to her almost by accident. \u201cI was at an antiques show in Sacramento,\u201d Unzelman recalls. \u201cI asked a dealer there if she had anything on wine. She said, \u2018No, not really, but I\u2019ve got this old scrapbook here that\u2019s got wine clippings in it.\u2019 It was a nice scrapbook, leather-bound and very thick. It happened to be C.W.A. president Percy Morgan\u2019s scrapbook.\u201d The scrapbook sat in Unzelman\u2019s closet with all her other binders and historical goodies for years, until Peninou came along with his draft of what became <em>The California Wine Association and Its Member Wineries</em>. \u201cThat Morgan scrapbook gave us a lot of information that wasn\u2019t known at the time,\u201d Unzelman says.</p>\n<p>Unlike the board members of the C.W.A., who represented the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of the California wine industry, Morgan was a money guy, which is to say he was an accountant, although his business card also bore a second, fancier title, \u201cFinancial Agent.\u201d During the late 1880s, Morgan helped manage the financial affairs of such forgotten San Francisco firms as Nevada Gypsum &amp; Fertilizer Co. and Pacific Auxiliary Fire Alarm Co., but in 1892, he gained a toehold in the world of wine by being named a director of the Samuel Lachman Estate Co., which managed the various holdings of the late Mr. Lachman, including his wine-merchant firm, S. Lachman Company. After their father\u2019s passing, Samuel\u2019s two sons aligned themselves with the C.W.A., turning over their two-million-gallon-capacity warehouse on Brannan Street in San Francisco to the association so it could store its wine there.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_65930\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"wp-image-65930 size-full\" src=\"https://d3h6k4kfl8m9p0.cloudfront.net/uploads/2015/12/11082911/BuenaVistaPlaque.jpg\" alt=\"Buena Vista Winery in Sonoma may be designated as State of California Landmark number 392, but it is not the \u201cbirthplace of California wine.\u201d (Via Buena Vista Winery)\"/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Buena Vista Winery in Sonoma may be designated as State of California Landmark number 392, but it is not the \u201cbirthplace of California wine.\u201d (Via Buena Vista Winery)</p></div>\n<p>Other than the Morgan scrapbook, it\u2019s a safe bet that a good portion of Unzelman\u2019s source materials overlapped with those Dinkelspiel studied at the Bancroft Library on the campus of the University of California at Berkeley. There, she learned about her family\u2019s wine lineage, beginning with her great-great-grandfather\u2019s winery in what was once a dusty speck of a town east of Los Angeles called Rancho Cucamonga. Southern California is where the state\u2019s wine industry began, despite a plaque at the <a href=\"http://www.buenavistawinery.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Buena Vista Winery</a> in the Northern California county of Sonoma, which identifies the 1857 site as State of California Landmark number 392 and the \u201cbirthplace of California wine.\u201d</p>\n<p>In fact, Southern California\u2019s place on the wine-history continuum begins in 1769, when the recently sainted Franciscan Father Junipero Serra founded the first of 21 California missions, including the one at San Juan Capistrano in 1776, where grape cuttings from Spain were planted. A few years later, at Mission San Gabriel Archangel near present-day Los Angeles, the fruit was found to thrive.</p>\n<p>As Dinkelspiel describes it in <em>Tangled Vines</em>, the local Native Americans whose souls were supposedly being saved at Mission San Gabriel \u201cwere treated like slaves\u201d by Father Jose Maria de Zalvidea, who directed them to clear 170 acres of chaparral-covered earth for row upon row of grape vines. \u201cIt was known as <em>La Vina Madre</em>, or the mother vineyard,\u201d Dinkelspiel writes. \u201cBy 1829, the mission may have been producing from 400 to 600 barrels of wine a year.\u201d</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_65932\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"wp-image-65932 size-full\" src=\"https://d3h6k4kfl8m9p0.cloudfront.net/uploads/2015/12/11083215/FrancesTapia2.jpg\" alt=\"Author Frances Dinkelspiel in Rancho Cucamonga, near the winery that was once owned by her great-great-grandfather Isaias Hellman.

Back then California was still a part of Mexico, so Tapia got his 13,000 acres directly from the Mexican government. Before long, the Cucamonga Vineyard, as it came to be called, covered more than 600 acres of the Rancho, making it a more accurate birthplace of the California wine industry. Sorry, Sonoma.</p>\n<p>By 1848, California was a territory of the United States\u2014statehood followed in 1850. After numerous changes in ownership, which Dinkelspiel covers in often bloody detail in <em>Tangled Vines,</em> in 1870, Isaias Hellman purchased the Cucamonga Rancho and Vineyard in a sheriff\u2019s sale to settle various claims against the Rancho and satisfy its debts. It\u2019s not known for sure if any of the grapes still growing at the Cucamonga Vineyard in 1870 had been taken directly from cuttings at <em>La Vina Madre</em>, but the character of the wine produced there was probably not markedly different from the sweet, sacramental stuff made for Serra and de Zalvidea.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_65938\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"wp-image-65938 size-full\" src=\"https://d3h6k4kfl8m9p0.cloudfront.net/uploads/2015/12/11111008/mother-grapevine.jpg\" alt=\"A linen postcard, circa 1930-1945, of the &quot;Mother Grapevine&quot; in San Gabriel.

(Via Digital Commonwealth)</p></div>\n<p>This raises an interesting question: What did 19th-century California wine taste like, anyway? \u201cIt\u2019s so undocumented,\u201d Unzelman says. \u201cI had a conversation recently with someone who was looking for tasting notes from that period, but they didn\u2019t describe wine like we do today. They would analyze a wine and say it had good acid, that it was bold, that it was red. Sometimes they might say a wine was \u2018velveteen,\u2019 but they wouldn\u2019t have said it had raspberry, blackberry, or cherry \u2018notes.\u2019 They didn\u2019t talk about wine that way.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote class=\"left\"><p>\u201cA sweet aphrodisiacal scent filled the air. The aroma, cooped up inside a bottle for ninety-three years, rushed out.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>Even so, we do have a few clues. To begin, we know that a sizable percentage of the wine produced in Southern California was fortified with brandy to lengthen its shelf life and increase its alcohol content. One type of fortified wine produced at the Cucamonga Vineyard before and during Hellman\u2019s 40-year ownership of the property was port. Another was Angelica, which was actually an unfermented, fortified, grape-juice-based beverage rather than a wine per se\u2014in wine circles, a blend of this type is called a <em>mistelle</em>.</p>\n<p>If you could time-travel a bottle of Angelica from the Southern California of that era to a restaurant like Boulevard today, it would not make the wine list. This is not a guess. In the middle of the 19th century, the state\u2019s wine was routinely sneered at by wine aficionados and, more importantly, wine merchants in New York, who also purchased wine from local sources in the eastern United States, as well as from European wineries. Before the transcontinental railroad was finished in 1869, California wine had to be shipped in \u201cpipes\u201d (large barrels holding about 125 gallons each) around South America\u2019s Cape Horn.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_65948\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"wp-image-65948 size-full\" src=\"https://d3h6k4kfl8m9p0.cloudfront.net/uploads/2015/12/11113314/Barrels-CWA.jpg\" alt=\"A barge of California wine barrels being loaded onto a cargo ship in San Francisco Bay, 1912. (Courtesy Gail Unzelman)\"/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A barge of California wine barrels being loaded onto a cargo ship in San Francisco Bay, 1912. (Courtesy Gail Unzelman)</p></div>\n<p>Was it worth the effort? In 1862, a professional wine taster in New York dismissed what was considered one of the best Los Angeles-area Angelicas, made by Sainsevain Brothers, as follows: \u201cA bottle full of it contains I don\u2019t know how many headaches.\u201d</p>\n<p>With praise like that, it makes you wonder why Hellman was so keen to get his hands on the Cucamonga Vineyard in 1870. Dinkelspiel thinks she knows the reason. \u201cI cannot speak to how much he loved wine,\u201d she says of her great-great-grandfather\u2019s motivations, \u201cbut he was very intrigued by the future of wine and agriculture. He was trying to make it a viable business.\u201d</p>\n<p>In 1901, therefore, the C.W.A. represented a new investment opportunity for Hellman in a familiar agricultural sector. Hellman may have had holdings and roots\u2014literally\u2014in Rancho Cucamonga, but he could plainly see that the industry was moving north. Sure, the Mission grapes that produced sweet, fortified wines like port did well in the south, but the climate was poorly suited to varietals that would produce the dry table wines that were becoming increasingly popular for daily drinking. Growers quickly discovered that counties like Sonoma and Napa were better for that. Sorry, SoCal.</p>\n<p>Indeed, in 1870, the same year Hellman bought the Cucamonga Vineyard and its hundreds of acres of Mission grapevines at a sheriff\u2019s sale, more visionary agricultural entrepreneurs were already planting neat rows of Zinfandel grapes in Sonoma. There, and on the other side of the Mayacamas Mountains in Napa, the seeds of the modern age of California winemaking were being sown, which perhaps accounts for the confusion of California\u2019s official historians.</p>\n\n<p>The data tell the tale of this migration north. In 1858, more than 46 percent of all the grapes grown and harvested in California came from the Los Angeles Viticultural District, home to the Cucamonga Vineyard. That year, Napa and Sonoma combined accounted for less than 10 percent\u2019s of the state\u2019s total production. A decade later, though, the two northern California counties were on par with Los Angeles, and by 1890, Napa and Sonoma could claim more than 50 percent of the state\u2019s total acreage in wine grapes, compared to less than 10 percent for L.A. Meanwhile, sweet-wine production was moving to the San Joaquin Valley. In short, Southern California no longer represented the future of California winemaking, and Hellman knew it.</p>\n<p>As a businessman, you\u2019d think Hellman might have balked at the idea of investing in an obvious monopoly, but according to Thomas Pinney in <em><a href=\"http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520269538\" target=\"_blank\">The Makers of American Wine</a></em>, the C.W.A. \u201cescaped attention from the Department of Justice,\u201d because antitrust laws at the time applied only to staple commodities, which the C.W.A. successfully argued wine was not. Similarly, the independent wine firms that became a part of the C.W.A. remained independent in their management after being subsumed into the C.W.A., presenting a veneer of competition between allegedly autonomous members, even though no such competition existed in practice.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_65940\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"wp-image-65940 size-full\" src=\"https://d3h6k4kfl8m9p0.cloudfront.net/uploads/2015/12/11111135/CWA-ad.jpg\" alt=\"A C.W.A. ad published in &quot;Pacific Wine and Spirit Review,&quot; late 1890s.

(Courtesy Gail Unzelman)</p></div>\n<p>But the most important salve against antitrust action, Pinney writes, was the policy of keeping retail wine prices reasonable\u2014if there was no price-gouging, regulators were encouraged to reason, how bad could this so-called monopoly really be? In fact, low prices were fine if you were a consumer, but, as Pinney writes, it \u201cwas of no apparent concern\u201d to regulators that \u201cin order to maintain modest prices, it might be necessary to gouge the grape grower and the winemaker.\u201d In fact, that gouging was exactly what precipitated the formation of the California Wine-Makers Corporation and triggered the wine wars of the 1890s.</p>\n<p>Stabilizing prices turned out to be the simplest part of the C.W.A.\u2019s job. Trickier was controlling its wines\u2019 reputation, which, at the turn of the 20th century, largely meant changing the way wine was bought and sold. To this end, the C.W.A. encouraged the practice of only shipping wine bottled and labeled in California to cities in the Midwest and on the eastern seaboard, since shipping wine in bulk clearly invited fraud.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s how it worked: Throughout the late 1800s, wine was routinely sold in large barrels known as pipes. Upon receipt of a pipe of perfectly good California wine, local wine merchants would often blend the liquid to suit their tastes. More notoriously, a pipe of eastern rotgut that a merchant may have been forced to acquire in a bulk purchase might be blended with a pipe of much better California wine before being bottled and sold with the local merchant\u2019s \u201cCalifornia-grown\u201d label on it. Naturally, if a consumer bought a bottle of alleged California wine that left a bad taste in their mouth, they\u2019d think twice before buying another, weakening overall demand.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_65946\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"wp-image-65946 size-full\" src=\"https://d3h6k4kfl8m9p0.cloudfront.net/uploads/2015/12/11112648/CWA-HQ-1906.jpg\" alt=\"Photo from the July 31, 1906 issue of the &quot;Pacific Wine &amp; Spirit Review,&quot; showing the damage to the C.W.A.'s Fourth Street cellars.

Since its founding in 1894, San Francisco had been C.W.A.\u2019s main base of business operations, the place where deals were struck and millions of gallons of wine was warehoused in sites across the city. After the ground stopped shaking, this geographic diversification looked like it had been a good idea since most of the C.W.A.\u2019s structures survived. But then came the fires, which consumed\u00a0most of the C.W.A.\u2019s warehouses. According to Charles Sullivan in the April 2006 edition of Unzelman\u2019s \u201cWayward Tendrils,\u201d \u201cOf the twenty-eight commercial wine establishments in the city, twenty-five were destroyed.\u201d</p>\n<p>The most famous C.W.A. survivor was the Italian-Swiss Colony cellar at Battery and Greenwich Streets near the San Francisco waterfront. It still stands there today, thanks to the Colony\u2019s founder, Andrea Sbarboro, who directed employees to flood the warehouse\u2019s roof with water pumped from a spring on the property. \u201cWe fought unceasingly for three days and three nights,\u201d Sbarboro would later write of the battle to keep the fires raging around him from reaching the Italian-Swiss Colony building. Two million gallons of C.W.A. wine were saved.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_65933\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://d3h6k4kfl8m9p0.cloudfront.net/uploads/2015/12/11083317/CWA1906PumpingWine4.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-65933\" src=\"https://d3h6k4kfl8m9p0.cloudfront.net/uploads/2015/12/11083317/CWA1906PumpingWine4.jpg\" alt=\"Photos taken by Percy Morgan showing how wine was pumped through fire hoses from C.W.A. headquarters and Third and Bryant Streets to tanks on an awaiting barge.

The spilled wine might have washed into the streets as it had at other warehouses, but a \u201cplugged sewer line\u201d and the building\u2019s solid concrete walls and floor kept the sloshing wine within the structure. Suddenly, the building itself had become a wine cellar, which enabled the C.W.A. to pump the precious liquid through fire hoses to a small fleet of barges, which were towed to Stockton in the San Joaquin Valley, where the wine was distilled into brandy.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"left\"><p>\u201cOf the twenty-eight commercial wine establishments in the city, twenty-five were destroyed.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>That was an acceptable solution to a difficult circumstance, since the distillation process neutralized the contaminants in the spilled C.W.A. wine, but the marketing plan for 35,000 bottles of wine that had not been destroyed at Third and Bryant was a good deal sketchier. \u201cThese bottles were supposedly cased with a special label as a souvenir of the disaster,\u201d writes a skeptical Sullivan in \u201cWayward Tendrils,\u201d and the wine was advertised as having been \u201cmellowed and ripened and aged by the heat,\u201d a specious claim at best. \u201cOf course this is a very expensive way to produce fine wines,\u201d read another C.W.A. announcement, \u201cand the Association will certainly not endeavor to repeat their success.\u201d</p>\n<p>In fact, Sullivan suggests these 35,000 bottles might never have existed at all, except perhaps in the overheated imagination of a public-relations flack. \u201cI have never seen any such label,\u201d Sullivan writes. \u201cNeither have I read anything about their later release or heard a word from anyone who has ever seen one.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dean Walters hasn\u2019t seen one, either, which is saying a lot since he was long the leading dealer of California wine ephemera. Today, Walters runs the <a href=\"http://earlycalwinetrade.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Early California Wine Trade Archive</a> and is working to create a museum to house his and a few others\u2019 sizable collections. \u201cWe hope to find space in an existing institution to exhibit our materials in a gallery setting and safely archive our materials,\u201d Walters says. \u201cThe intent is to have changing displays focusing on wineries, districts, or special subjects.\u201d</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_65891\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://d3h6k4kfl8m9p0.cloudfront.net/uploads/2015/12/08122744/Winehaven.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-65891 size-full\" src=\"https://d3h6k4kfl8m9p0.cloudfront.net/uploads/2015/12/08172604/CWA-Lede.jpg\" alt=\"This colorful postcard of Winehaven seems to promise happier, more prosperous times after the trauma of the 1906 earthquake and the fires that followed.

(Courtesy Gail Unzelman)</p></div>\n<p>One subject might well be Winehaven, which Percy Morgan set out to build almost immediately after the fires caused by the earthquake had died down\u2014the association would battle its insurance companies, who refused to pay legitimate fire-insurance claims, all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which finally ruled in its favor in 1910. Strategically located at Point Molate in Richmond, Winehaven allowed Morgan to consolidate the C.W.A.\u2019s activities in one place, which he believed would be economically more efficient than having lots of warehouses spread all over San Francisco.</p>\n<p>It was. The east side of San Francisco Bay, which lacked bridges at the time, was also closer to transcontinental railroad lines than San Francisco, while its rail-equipped deep-water dock anticipated the shipping lane that would open through the Panama Canal in 1914. In addition, the pier made it easy to offload grapes grown in Napa and Sonoma counties, which could be sent down the Napa and Petaluma Rivers and across the bay to Winehaven for the fall crush. Some 25,000 tons of grapes were crushed at Winehaven in 1907, and in 1908, workers handled 45,000 tons of fruit, producing more than 675,000 gallons of wine that year.</p>\n<p>Beyond its winemaking, bottling, and storage capabilities, Winehaven offered C.W.A. members cooperage services to help replace the thousands of tanks, barrels, and casks that had been destroyed in the 1906 fires. The oak for such containers had come from Arkansas and Tennessee, but after the 1906 earthquake, suppliers in those states jacked up prices by 40 percent. Coopers at Winehaven, therefore, turned to good old California redwood, which meant wine-storage containers of all sizes could be built for less than half the cost of oak ones.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_65941\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"wp-image-65941 size-full\" src=\"https://d3h6k4kfl8m9p0.cloudfront.net/uploads/2015/12/11111740/Winehaven-from-Below.jpg\" alt=\"View of Building One at Winehaven today.

Note the braces holding the brick turret in place.</p></div>\n<p>Architecturally, the crown jewel of Winehaven was Building One, which was clad in brick and featured \u201ccrenelated parapets and turrets on the corners,\u201d to quote Sullivan.\u00a0Like the C.W.A.\u2019s headquarters at Third and Bryant Streets in San Francisco, Building One\u2019s floors and ceiling were made of poured concrete, further reinforced by an inner skeleton of thick steel posts and beams. This construction method proved quite durable, surviving several decades of hard use by the Navy, which converted Point Molate into a fuel depot during World War II, as well as the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, which flattened a freeway and ruptured a section of the bridge between Oakland and San Francisco.</p>\n<p>For Percy Morgan\u2019s purposes, Winehaven was durable enough to help the C.W.A. solidify its hold on the California wine industry. By 1909, the Calwa Distributing Company was formed \u201cto bring the consumer, in glass, the best wines of the California Wine Association,\u201d as Peninou and Unzelman put it in their book. Calwa and Ca-dis-co became two of the C.W.A.\u2019s biggest brands of \u201cpure reliable wines,\u201d as they were advertised.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, keeping the C.W.A. on its feet after the earthquake and during the construction of Winehaven had come at the price of Morgan\u2019s health\u2014by 1911, he would retire from the C.W.A. after 15 years at its helm, retreating to Europe for three years of \u201crest and recuperation\u201d before returning home to serve on numerous boards (Stanford University among them) and build a three-story, half-timbered mansion south of San Francisco known as Morgan Manor.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_65942\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"wp-image-65942 size-full\" src=\"https://d3h6k4kfl8m9p0.cloudfront.net/uploads/2015/12/11112129/Rail-Dock-Final.jpg\" alt=\"Railroad tracks on the deep-water pier at Winehaven made it early to load or unload ships and barges that docked there.

(Courtesy Gail Unzelman)</p></div>\n<p>Despite Morgan\u2019s exit from the C.W.A., the second decade of the 20th century began well for the association. \u201cWhen the 1910 European vintage was virtually wiped out by bad weather,\u201d Peninou and Unzelman write, \u201cthe California wine industry correspondingly prospered.\u201d That\u2019s one reason why, by 1913, the association was investing in numerous improvements and expansions at Winehaven.</p>\n<p>At the same time, though, the C.W.A.\u2019s future was cloudy. The association\u2019s aging leaders were literally dying off, the outbreak of war in Europe in 1914 had slowed exports, and, most ominously of all, the growing Prohibition movement in the United States suggested that it was only a matter of time before the C.W.A.\u2019s very livelihood\u2014selling alcoholic beverages\u2014would be illegal.</p>\n<p>In fact, the association first acted on the threat of Prohibition in 1907, when it began producing grape juice in earnest. By the end of 1909, the C.W.A. was selling both still and sparkling non-alcoholic grape drinks\u2014produced in red (Zinfandel) and white (Muscatel) at a facility in the San Joaquin Valley\u2014under the Calwa brand. \u201cCalwa Grape Juice Steadies the Nerves,\u201d promised one advertisement. The slogan may well have been a subconscious attempt to steady the nerves of C.W.A. officials, too.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_65943\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-65943 size-full\" src=\"https://d3h6k4kfl8m9p0.cloudfront.net/uploads/2015/12/11112206/Calwa-Juice-Bottle.jpg\" alt=\"As the clouds of Prohibition loomed, the C.W.A. put more of its energies and resources into non-alcoholic grape beverages such as Calwa.

(Courtesy Gail Unzelman)</p></div>\n<p>Other C.W.A. actions betrayed more overt alarm. As early as 1908, the C.W.A. had been slowing its purchases of grapes from its growers, lest its inventories grow <em>too</em> quickly, and in 1909, it published a 62-page booklet promoting the enlightened ideal of temperance versus outright Prohibition, quoting Thomas Jefferson and St. Paul to make its case. Congress didn\u2019t help matters when, in 1915, it raised the tax on the brandy used to fortify port and other C.W.A. products from three to 55 cents per gallon. And then, in 1916, the C.W.A. found itself fighting a pair of pro-Prohibition amendments on the California ballot, reprinting and distributing hundreds of thousands of copies of a booklet titled \u201cHow Prohibition Would Affect California\u201d to help sway public opinion.</p>\n<p>In the end, California voters rejected both measures, but this victory at the ballot box would not derail the Prohibition movement. Since the C.W.A. could see that it would not be long before Prohibition would become the law of the land, it began to rid itself of the millions of gallons of wine it had in storage at Winehaven. But 1917 was a very bad year to be selling wine. By the end of the year, Congress had passed the 18th Amendment banning the \u201cthe manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors,\u201d which was promptly sent to the states for ratification.</p>\n<p>With the market for its goods soft at home, the C.W.A. looked internationally for buyers, but the war in Europe made exports to that region problematic, and even after war ended in November 1918, Europe was an economic shambles, making it a poor customer for California wine. One of the few bright spots in the C.W.A.\u2019s efforts to liquidate its liquid assets came from former C.W.A. nemesis\u2014and 1906 savior\u2014Italian-Swiss Colony, which managed to sell 84,000 cases of its Golden State champagne into Asian markets for more than $1 million.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_65915\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"wp-image-65915 size-full\" src=\"https://d3h6k4kfl8m9p0.cloudfront.net/uploads/2015/12/10151340/CWA-Sign-600.jpg\" alt=\"To combat the fraud that occurred when its wine was shipped out of state in barrels and pipes, which could be blended before bottling, the C.W.A. promoted the practice of shipping its wine in bottles.\"/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">To combat the fraud that occurred when its wine was shipped out of state in barrels and pipes, which could be blended before bottling, the C.W.A. promoted the practice of shipping its wine in bottles.

On the morning of April 16, 1920, just three months after the passage of the Volstead Act, which put regulatory teeth in the 18th Amendment, the C.W.A.\u2019s former leader, still in his pajamas, walked into the library of Morgan Manor, raised a shotgun to his head, and pulled the trigger.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the increasingly desperate C.W.A. was trying to relocate its grape-juice business from the San Joaquin Valley to Winehaven, but this costly effort failed to generate the revenues needed to keep the enterprise afloat. As for its wine inventory, it was slowly sold as the law permitted\u2014some export licenses were granted after Prohibition, and some of the liquid in the barrels at Winehaven were sold as sacramental wine, bringing the story of California\u2019s wine history full circle.</p>\n<p>As it turns out, a small amount of the wine stored at Winehaven may have been owned by the heirs of Isaias Hellman, who passed away from natural causes about a week before Morgan\u2019s violent end. According to Frances Dinkelspiel, there were two types of Hellman wine that may have been stored at Winehaven at the beginning of Prohibition, port and Angelica, both made from Mission grapes that had been planted as early as 1839 by Tiburcio Tapia. The Hellman wine was not that old\u2014it was crushed in 1875\u2014and it would not be bottled until 1921, when a Santa Rosa company, Grace Bros. Brewing, purchased the C.W.A. name and remaining wine inventory at Winehaven.</p>\n<p>\u201cJoseph Grace was a family friend,\u201d Dinkelspiel says. \u201cI don\u2019t know this for a fact, but I speculate that he found these barrels and bottled them up for the family. During Prohibition, there were a lot of restrictions on wine, but you could make and own a certain amount of \u2018home\u2019 wine. Anyway, that\u2019s what I think happened.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dinkelspiel estimates that probably no more than 600 bottles of her great-great-grandfather\u2019s wine were filled in 1921, about half in port and half in Angelica. One of Dinkelspiel\u2019s cousins ended up with less than a third of those bottles, 175 of which were stored in the wine warehouse that was torched by an arsonist in 2005\u2014the primary subject of her book\u2014obliterating her most tangible connection to her family\u2019s wine legacy. For Dinkelspiel, the warehouse fire was not just a juicy story, it was personal.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_65944\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"wp-image-65944 size-full\" src=\"https://d3h6k4kfl8m9p0.cloudfront.net/uploads/2015/12/11112352/Bobby-on-Roof.jpg\" alt=\"Winehaven advocate Bobby Winston on the roof of Building One. \"/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Winehaven advocate Bobby Winston on the roof of Building One.</p></div>\n<p>After reading her book, gulping its chapters like so many glasses of Far Niente Chardonnay at Boulevard, I realized I needed to see Winehaven for myself. To that end, Dinkelspiel got me in touch with Bobby Winston, who owns a publication called \u201cBay Crossings.\u201d In turn, Winston introduced me to Willie Agnew, who is the caretaker at Point Molate and the guy who actually showed us around, doing everything from leading us onto Building One\u2019s sunny roof to unlocking the structure\u2019s mysterious basement.</p>\n<p>As I quickly learned, Winston is one of Winehaven\u2019s biggest boosters. He believes the property, now designated as the Winehaven National Historic District, is a natural spot for thoughtful redevelopment, including a winery. After all, it\u2019s got all that wine history going for it, plus unobstructed views across the bay to Mount Tamalpais in Marin, making it a natural future tourist destination. Having grown during its naval years, Winehaven now stands at 71 acres, which Winston believes make it big enough to support a variety of small businesses, whose rent checks would help pay for its upkeep, similar to the successful private-public partnership at the historic Presidio in San Francisco.</p>\n<p>Today, Building One is still the most iconic structure at Point Molate. Walking the grounds, one can almost picture the site\u2019s winemaking and naval history being told through interpretive displays and exhibits. Wandering inside the empty structure, one can equally imagine the rows of redwood casks, filled with millions of gallons of wine, that must have consumed this now-silent space. The bones of the building would probably support such tonnage still, but the unreinforced brick walls inside and out would be costly to bring up to code\u2014the building\u2019s signature brick turrets are currently held in place by wide rings of aluminum.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_65945\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"wp-image-65945 size-full\" src=\"https://d3h6k4kfl8m9p0.cloudfront.net/uploads/2015/12/11112429/Inside-White-Columns.jpg\" alt=\"The inside of Building One features concrete floors and ceilings, with heavy steel framing throughout.\"/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The inside of Building One features concrete floors and ceilings, with heavy steel framing throughout.</p></div>\n<p>Making such band-aid reinforcements permanent, as well as figuring out which of the other remaining Winehaven structures are worth saving, would probably only be a small part of the cost of bringing new life to the historic site. Substantial infrastructure improvements would be required before the first glass of wine was poured in Winehaven\u2019s first tasting room. According to a report prepared by Winston for Richmond\u2019s mayor, Tom Butt, Point Molate lacks electrical power, which is why this section of bayfront is still dark at night\u2014if you ever find yourself driving east across the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge after sundown, look to your left, and you\u2019ll see what I mean.</p>\n<p>Plumbing is also a major problem. All of the water to the area flows through a single 12-inch pipe, and there is no collection system to send sewage in the opposite direction. Finally, there\u2019s the road, which is just a single lane in each direction, with little room on either side for widening. And while there\u2019s an exit off Interstate 580 to Point Molate if you are heading west, eastbound visitors must navigate a tangle of poorly marked boulevards, drives, and avenues. All of which explains why Winston, despite his enthusiasm and affection for Winehaven, believes the process of figuring out what to do with the site is probably decades away.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_65916\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"wp-image-65916 size-full\" src=\"https://d3h6k4kfl8m9p0.cloudfront.net/uploads/2015/12/10151546/HellmanBottles.jpg\" alt=\"The last two bottles of Frances Dinkelspiel's stash of her great-great-grandfather's wine.\"/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The last two bottles of Frances Dinkelspiel\u2019s stash of her great-great-grandfather\u2019s wine. (Via <a href=\"http://francesdinkelspiel.com/\" target=\"_blank\">francesdinkelspiel.com</a>)</p></div>\n<p>For her part, Dinkelspiel has Winehaven to thank for preserving those precious bottles of 19th-century Hellman wine, even if the bulk of her inheritance was torched by an arsonist in 2005. Fortunately, she kept a couple of bottles of Hellman in her home. By the end of <em>Tangled Vines</em>, curiosity about what\u2019s in those bottles has gotten the best of her, so she determines to taste their contents with an expert whose palate is at least on par with that 1862 taster who had written off the best Angelica in Southern California as being little more than a bottle of headaches. In fact, Dinkelspiel found an individual whose palate is no doubt light-years more discerning, a master sommelier named Fred Dame.</p>\n<p>As she tells it in her book, Dame is a tough sell at first, but eventually Dinkelspiel convinces him to let her bring her last bottle of her great-great-grandfather\u2019s port to Dame\u2019s home so they may taste it and let the chips fall where they may. In <em>Tangled Vines</em>, she describes the care Dame takes to break the wax seal from the top of the bottle, and the way he eases the corkscrew into the cork. It crumbles, but is still moist at the bottom, a good sign.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlmost immediately,\u201d Dinkelspiel writes, \u201ca sweet aphrodisiacal scent filled the air. I was standing about four feet away from the bottle yet I could smell the Port\u2019s fumes. The aroma, cooped up inside a bottle for ninety-three years, rushed out.\u201d</p>\n<p>The translucent liquid itself, she writes, is dark amber, \u201calmost the color of the redwood it was once stored in.\u201d And then Dame pours two glasses, and for the first time in her life, Dinkelspiel brings her great-great-grandfather\u2019s wine to her lips. \u201cI lifted my glass and let the Port swirl over my tongue,\u201d she writes. \u201cI wasn\u2019t prepared for the intensity of flavor. Sweetness exploded over my taste buds, followed by a pleasant sharpness.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt has a wonderful old clay smell that I love,\u201d she quotes Dame as saying. \u201cIt has almost a sour cherry quality to it, like cherries soaked in brandy,\u201d Dame says, concluding with his much-anticipated verdict: \u201cIt\u2019s phenomenal.\u201d</p>\n<p>Maybe that\u2019s why Hellman invested in the Cucamonga Vineyard. And maybe, just maybe, that other Southern California Angelica, ripped to shreds by a grumpy New York taster in 1862, got a bad rap. \u201cI\u2019ve never tasted the Angelica,\u201d Dinkelspiel says. \u201cA family member who has tasted it said it\u2019s very good. I do have one bottle of Angelica,\u201d she adds. \u201cI\u2019m kind of tempted to open it one day, but I haven\u2019t\u2014yet.\u201d</p>\n<p>(<em>Thanks to <a href=\"http://francesdinkelspiel.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Frances Dinkelspiel</a>, <a href=\"http://earlycalwinetrade.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Dean Walters</a>, <a href=\"http://www.gailunzelman.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Gail Unzelman</a>, <a href=\"http://baycrossings.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Bobby Winston</a>, and Willie Agnew for their help with this story.

But Parscale insists he never used psychographics. He said it doesn't work.</p><p>Lesley Stahl: So you didn't use it because you didn't think it really worked, as opposed to you didn't use it because you thought it was wrong that it was manipulative or sinister, or something like that.</p><p>Brad Parscale: No, I don't believe it's sinister.</p><p>Lesley Stahl: No. OK, you just don't think it works.</p><p>Brad Parscale: No, I just don't think it works.</p><p>Parscale's title was digital director, but by the end of the campaign his portfolio grew. He oversaw data collection, polling, advertising both online and on TV, and significantly digital fund raising. By adding donation buttons for people to click on in the online ads, he was able to bring in a record $240 million in small donations.</p><p>Lesley Stahl: How many presidential campaigns had you worked on before this one?</p><p>Brad Parscale: Zero.</p><p>Lesley Stahl: Your wife has a wonderful expression about you being thrown into this.</p><p>Brad Parscale: Yeah.\u00a0 She said that I was thrown into the Super Bowl, never played a game and won.</p><p>Lesley Stahl: That's what it sounds like.</p><p>It's made him a local hero back home in Kansas. He grew up in Topeka, playing basketball \u2013 he's 6 foot 8. After briefly working at a tech company in California, he moved to San Antonio, Texas, and became a marketer. He taught himself to code, opened a small web-design business and went looking for customers.</p><p>Brad Parscale: I started tapping shoulders at a bookstore asking people if they needed a website, when they were buying books on web design.</p><p>Lesley Stahl: Yeah, but what-- you're hanging around at a bookstore?</p><p>Brad Parscale: Yeah, a Border's.</p><p>Lesley Stahl: You're hanging around at Border's and say, \"Can you hire me?\" </p><p>Brad Parscale: Yeah.</p><p>Lesley Stahl: Come-on. </p><p>Brad Parscale: Yeah.</p><p>Lesley Stahl: So how did you get involved with the Trump people?</p><p>Brad Parscale: I was sitting at IHOP and I got an email. I was eating a ham and cheese omelet. I was. I get an email and I open it up and it says-- \"This is Kathy K. from the Trump Org-- can you please call me?\" That's it\u2014</p><p>Lesley Stahl: Outta nowhere?</p><p>Brad Parscale: Outta nowhere.</p><p>Six years ago she was looking for someone to design a website for a Trump real estate project. Parscale bid lowest, got the job, and soon many more followed: websites for Eric's foundation, Melania's skincare line, the family's wineries. Then, in early 2015, came another life-changing email:</p><p>Brad Parscale: It said \"Donald Trump is thinking about running for president. We need a website in two days.\" So I wrote back, I said, \"Yeah, I'll do it for $1500.\"</p><p>Lesley Stahl: $1500?</p><p>Brad Parscale: Yeah. And by the end, it was $94 million.</p><p>$94 million is what his company was paid. Much of it was spent on things like buying ads.\u00a0 Parscale learned very fast on the job, with the help of the Republican National Committee. They had amassed a giant database to identify the issues people cared about, and predict how nearly 200 million Americans would vote.</p><p>One reason Parscale thinks President Trump won is because of an issue the RNC database honed in on that he says the Clinton campaign missed:</p><p>Lesley Stahl: Infrastructure.</p><p>Brad Parscale: Infrastructure. It was voters in the rust belt that cared about their roads being rebuilt, their highways, their bridges. They felt like the world was crumbling. \u00a0So I started making ads that would show the bridge crumbling. You know, that's microtargeting them. Because I can find the 1,500 people in one town that care about infrastructure. Now, that might be a voter that normally votes Democrat.</p><p>While he tried to persuade Democrats to vote for Mr. Trump \u2013 the campaign was accused, in a Businessweek article, of trying to <em>suppress</em> the vote of \"idealistic white liberals, young women and African Americans,\" a charge he denies.</p><p>Lesley Stahl: Did you micro target by race?</p><p>Brad Parscale: No we did not. Not at all.</p><p>Lesley Stahl: Never?</p><p>Brad Parscale: Nope.</p><p>Lesley Stahl: Did you post hateful images?</p><p>Brad Parscale: I don't believe so.</p><p>Lesley Stahl: The candidate Trump was never shy about pushing buttons, about pushing prejudices. He used what most people would consider offensive language sometimes.</p><p>Brad Parscale: I don't think the math said that most people saw it as offensive. I think a small group of people saw it as offensive, who have a lot of power.</p><p>Lesley Stahl: But you did mirror him?</p><p>Brad Parscale: We mirrored certain things that he would say, mainly things he said in rallies.</p><p>Many of the messages he sent out were what's known as dark ads. They're called dark because they're microtargeted to individual users who are the only ones who see them.\u00a0 Unless they choose to share them \u2013 they disappear.\u00a0</p><p>Lesley Stahl: Can you say anything you want in those dark ads? They're really not transparent?</p><p>Brad Parscale: No, because if I said something crazy in those, they would share a million times, it would be all over.</p><p>Lesley Stahl: So if you said something that appealed to racists?</p><p>Brad Parscale: Oh, it would be everywhere.</p><p>But <em>some</em> dark ads flew under the radar, like ones sent out, we now know, by the Russians in their attempt to influence our election. These were separate from the posts the Russians reportedly sent of fake news stories that made Clinton look bad. The <em>ads</em> \u2013 on divisive issues \u2013 were spread using Facebook tools similar to the ones Parscale and the Clinton campaign used.</p><p>Lesley Stahl: Facebook has admitted that the Russians spent $100,000 -- at least $100,000 -- on ads to influence the U.S. campaign. Does that bother you?</p><p>Brad Parscale: Yeah, I would not want a foreign entity to meddle in our election; you know, a government. Yeah, I mean, I wouldn't want that; I'm American.</p><p>But the question is: did the Trump campaign collude with the Russians \u2013 and as the digital director, was Parscale involved?</p><p>Brad Parscale: I think it's a joke. Like, at least for my part in it.</p><p>Lesley Stahl: Very few people think it's a joke.</p><p>Brad Parscale: I think it's a joke when they involve myself. 'Cause I know my own activities, and I know the activities of this campaign. I was there. It's just a farce.</p><p>Lesley Stahl: It's a farce that you colluded with the Russians?</p><p>Brad Parscale: Yeah. It's just a joke.</p><p>What about what happened on Twitter? Which was flooded with pro-Trump tweets generated by robots, or bots.</p><p>Lesley Stahl: Did you have a hand in generating these bots\u2014</p><p>Brad Parscale: I had nothing to do with bots. I don't think bots work.</p><p>Lesley Stahl: You were called the king of the bots.</p><p>Brad Parscale: I know. It's ridiculous. It's just the craziest thing ever. No one on our team ever sat down with me and said, \"Brad, we should make bots.\"</p><p>Lesley Stahl: But if-- if you see that there are hundreds of thousands of bots floating around with pro-Trump messages, somebody generated it. Where would it come from?</p><p>Brad Parscale: I would imagine there were people, everyday people in America, who thought they were trying to help. I don't know.</p><p>Lesley Stahl: If the bots came from the Russians, would you know?</p><p>Brad Parscale:\u00a0 Nah.</p><p>Lesley Stahl: Do you think it might have?</p><p>Brad Parscale:\u00a0 No idea.</p><p>Lesley Stahl: Could it have?</p><p>Brad Parscale: Could be from anybody in the world. </p><p>The House Intelligence Committee looking into the Russian meddling has contacted Parscale and he's agreed to talk to them.\u00a0 \u00a0</p><p>Lesley Stahl: I understand that part of these investigations that are going on is to understand how the Russians knew where to target their campaigns, their messages. They seemed to know specifically where to go-- that were places that helped Trump.</p><p>Brad Parscale: Yeah. First of all, I-- it's not very hard to figure out. Pennsylvania, Ohio, you know. I mean, the same-- I think we've had the same swing states for decades. </p><p>Parscale told us the Russian plotline is pushed by liberals who think they lost because he cheated. The irony, he says, is that it wasn't a foreign entity helping the campaign, but left-leaning American companies like Twitter, Google, and above all Facebook.</p><p>Brad Parscale: These social platforms are all invented by very liberal people on the West and East Coast, and we figure out how to use it to push conservative values. I don't think they ever thought that would happen. I would say the number one thing that people come up to me is, like, \"I just never thought Republicans would be the ones to figure out how to use all this.\"</p><p>Lesley Stahl: So a liberal invents all this stuff and a conservative in the Middle-West figures out how to use it?</p><p>Brad Parscale: And I think we used it better than anyone ever had in history. </p><p>Last month, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced plans to make political ads on the site more transparent. As for Brad Parscale, he's already working on President Trump's 2020 reelection campaign.</p><p><em>Produced by Shachar Bar-On.

<p>This map shows the real value of $100 in each state. Prices for the same goods are often much cheaper in states like Missouri or Ohio than they are in states like New York or California. As a result, the same amount of cash can buy you comparatively more in a low-price state than in a high-price state.</p>\n<p>The Bureau of Economic Analysis has been measuring this phenomenon for two years now; it recently <a href=\"https://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/regional/rpp/rpp_newsrelease.htm\">published</a> its data for prices in 2015. Using this data, we have adjusted the value of $100 to show how much it buys you in each state.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://files.taxfoundation.org/20170803113208/100-Map-01.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-52858\" src=\"https://files.taxfoundation.org/20170803113208/100-Map-01.png\" alt=\"Real Value of $100 State Map 2017\" srcset=\"https://files.taxfoundation.org/20170803113208/100-Map-01.png 1355w, https://files.taxfoundation.org/20170803113208/100-Map-01-300x273.png 300w, https://files.taxfoundation.org/20170803113208/100-Map-01-768x698.png 768w, https://files.taxfoundation.org/20170803113208/100-Map-01-1024x931.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1355px) 100vw, 1355px\"/></a></p>\n<p>For example, Ohio is a low-price state. There, $100 will buy you goods that would cost $112.11 in a state at the national average price level. You could think of this as meaning that Ohioans are, for the purposes of day-to-day living, 12 percent richer than their incomes suggest.</p>\n<p>The states where $100 is worth the most are Mississippi ($116.01), Alabama ($115.21), Arkansas ($114.42), South Dakota ($113.38), and Kentucky ($112.87). In contrast, $100 is effectively worth the least in Hawaii ($84.18), the District of Columbia ($85.47), New York ($86.73), New Jersey ($88.18), and California ($88.18). <a href=\"#table1\">See the table at the bottom of this post</a> for a ranking of all 50 states.</p>\n<p>Regional price differences are strikingly large; real purchasing power is 36 percent greater in Mississippi than it is in the District of Columbia. In other words, by this measure, if you have $50,000 in after-tax income in Mississippi, you would need after-tax earnings of $68,000 in the District of Columbia just to afford the same overall standard of living.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s generally the case that states with higher nominal incomes also have higher price levels. This is because in places with higher incomes, the prices of finite resources like land get bid up. (This is especially true in cities.) What is also true is that places with high costs of living pay higher salaries for the same jobs. This is what labor economists call a compensating differential; the higher pay is offered in order to make up for the low purchasing power.</p>\n<p>This relationship is important, although it does not always hold true. Some states, like North Dakota, have high incomes without high prices. Adjusting incomes for price level can substantially change our perceptions of which states are truly poor or rich.</p>\n<p>For example, New Yorkers and North Dakotans earn approximately the same amount in dollars per capita, but after adjusting for regional price parity, North Dakotan incomes can buy more.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://files.taxfoundation.org/20170803112811/100-Map-03.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-52856\" src=\"https://files.taxfoundation.org/20170803112811/100-Map-03.png\" alt=\"Real Value of $100 Comparison 2017\" srcset=\"https://files.taxfoundation.org/20170803112811/100-Map-03.png 1251w, https://files.taxfoundation.org/20170803112811/100-Map-03-300x215.png 300w, https://files.taxfoundation.org/20170803112811/100-Map-03-768x551.png 768w, https://files.taxfoundation.org/20170803112811/100-Map-03-1024x734.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1251px) 100vw, 1251px\"/></a></p>\n<p>This has substantial implications for public policy, which is often progressive with respect to income.</p>\n<p>Many policies \u2013 like minimum wage, public benefits, and tax brackets \u2013 are denominated in dollars. But with different price levels in each state, the amounts aren\u2019t equivalent in purchasing power. This has some unexpected consequences \u2013 people in high price-level states like New Jersey will often pay more in federal taxes without feeling particularly rich.</p>\n<hr/>\n<a

Ive, the guy who designed the iPhone, is worried about the way people engage his creation, emphasizes an important point: there\u2019s something broken about our current relationship with our technology.</p>\n<p>Our culture was quick to accept the idea that we\u2019d end up checking these things constantly.

It is not hard to picture the potentially catastrophic damage to a company that earns its revenue by online advertising if it were knocked offline, or to an online retailer if an unscrupulous competitor hired a criminal to launch an attack on the former's website at the height of the holiday shopping season. In fact, on multiple occasions we have seen <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/joseph-steinberg/why-half-the-internet-is-broken-right-now.html\">clear examples of the damage that DDoS attacks can inflict</a>. Furthermore, as I discussed earlier this week, criminals are now <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/joseph-steinberg/cybercriminals-threaten-companies-around-globe-with-ddos-attacks.html\">demanding that firms pay them or face DDoS attacks</a> - a 2017 version of classic \"protection money\" extortion.</p>\n<p>Over the past decade various technologies have emerged that help reduce the risk of DDoS attacks - but the capabilities of the criminals launching the attacks have greatly advanced as well. With the mass proliferation of insecure Internet of Things devices and the easy availability of exploit code, attackers have access to a multitude of easily-comprised potential zombies, making DDoS attacks a significant danger.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the Achilles Heel of many DDoS defenses is that they must absorb large amounts of attack traffic - a process which can utilize a lot of bandwidth and processing power, and be quite expensive. As such, criminals benefit from a tremendous advantage: they normally launch DDoS attacks from \"zombies\" - that is, computers that they have taken control of via malware - so they obtain their necessary resources for free.</p>\n<p>Because of the cost of absorbing large volumes of data, many DDoS protection firms charge businesses for handling huge traffic loads - with Uber-like \"surge pricing\" - making DDoS attacks very expensive even to those organizations that successfully mitigate against them. Other defense firms may charge businesses more up front to ensure profitability even if DDoS attacks do occur, or may terminate customer accounts if a customer turns into a losing proposition. Last year, for example, after criminals launched <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/09/the-democratization-of-censorship/\">a massive DDoS attack at security journalist Brian Krebs' website</a> - which was, at the time, protected pro bono by Akamai - <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/article/krebs-on-security-booted-off-akamai-network-after-ddos-attack-proves-pricey/\">Akamai told Krebs to take his site's protection needs elsewhere</a>. Additionally, even the most robust anti-DDoS infrastructures may be taxed by growing DDoS attacks; there is a limit to how many entities they can adequately protect at once. Hacktivists - that is, hackers attacking parties for activist-type rationales - have even taken down some sites when attacking other sites using the same DDoS protection service.</p>\n<p>I recently spoke with a startup that is working to use the blockchain technology to address these shortcomings, to dramatically reduce the cost of protecting against DDoS attacks, and, ultimately, to render DDoS attacks far less effective. Blockchain, is of course, the technology underlying cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and smart contract systems like Ethereum. It allows for the sharing of information through a nearly-incorruptible digital ledger that is distributed all over the Internet, requires no central authority for management, and protects entries by effectively allowing them to be made only by the parties authorized to do so. I will write a detailed explanation of blockchain in an upcoming piece.</p>\n<p>By using blockchain, Maryland-based <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://gladius.io/\">Gladius</a> is creating a system that would allow people to rent out their unused bandwidth so that it can be used to absorb malicious DDoS traffic and mitigate against attacks. For most adults of working age, the vast majority of the bandwidth of their home Internet connection sits idle during the workday; in much the same way that Airbnb lets people utilize their home to make money when it would have otherwise sat idle and empty, Gladius plans to allow folks to leverage their Internet connections when they would not normally be heavily used. By leveraging the blockchain, Gladius eliminates the middle man between bandwidth providers and those needing it, and eliminates the need to buy bandwidth other than during an actual attack - so, businesses buy only the bandwidth that they actually need. Web site owners could also use the system to accelerate the delivery of content - as computers all over the world could function effectively as remote deliverers of cached data (in what would technically be known as a Content Delivery Network or CDN). Payments on Gladius are done with its own cryptocurrency - GLA - which ostensibly will be bought and sold on crypto exchanges. Gladius will begin offering GLA in an <span> </span><a href=\"https://www.inc.com/video/everything-you-need-to-know-about-icos-in-less-than-2-minutes.html\">Initial Coin Offering (ICO)</a> in October, and plans to go live early next year.</p>\n<p>Like any other startup, Gladius will certainly face challenges, and it is obviously too early to know whether the firm or other blockchain technologies will ultimately capture the DDoS protection market from established businesses, but the advent of a new, democratized model of protection and financial opportunity - allowing for potentially better utilization of resources by everyone across the Internet ecosystem - is certainly an exciting development. Ironically, if Gladius is successful, it will need to implement security to ensure that criminals don't monetize zombies in the future by transforming them from DDoS attackers into rented defenders <em>against</em> DDoS attacks.</p>\n<p>Gladius may be pioneering the use of blockchain for DDoS protection, but it is certainly not the only party using blockchain technology to advance security. I am certain that over the upcoming years we will see other blockchain-based security technologies emerge - offering better models for optimizing the allocation of resources to solve long-established security challenges.</p></div>\n\t</div></body></html>"}, "15430977": {"score": 2, "comments": [], "time": "2017-10-09 04:11:57", "url": "https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/failure-taught-me-lesson-ill-never-forget-melinda-gates/?linkId=43244080", "text": "UNAVAILABLE TEXT BY URL https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/failure-taught-me-lesson-ill-never-forget-melinda-gates/?linkId=43244080"}, "15430981": {"score": 22, "comments": ["&gt; When prospective business partners meet Mr. Cherkashin, he said, they often ask him if his money is clean.<p>&quot;Yes of course it&#x27;s clean, it was just laundered&quot;", "I&#x27;d love to see a tongue in cheek time series graph titled: &quot;How Much Russians are the Enemy (by public perception)&quot;<p>Feels like we are higher than the seasonal norm these days.", "Well.

Basic economics tells us that when workers are in higher demand, employers should have to pay more for their services. But in recent years, as unemployment has fallen below 5 percent in the United States, wages have not been increasing as fast as in the past. Economists debate the reasons; workers grapple with the consequences.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n    </div>&#13;\n&#13;\n    &#13;\n&#13;\n    &#13;\n      <div class=\"g-item g-text \">&#13;\n    &#13;\n&#13;\n      <p class=\"g-body\">The unemployment rate has fallen to a comfortable level, but wage growth is sluggish.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n    </div>&#13;\n&#13;\n    &#13;\n&#13;\n    &#13;\n      <div class=\"g-item g-text \">&#13;\n    &#13;\n&#13;\n      <p class=\"g-body\">When the two trends are superimposed, the historical pattern in which wages pick up when unemployment falls has not held this time around.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n    </div>&#13;\n&#13;\n    &#13;\n&#13;\n    &#13;\n      <div class=\"g-item g-text \">&#13;\n    &#13;\n&#13;\n      <p class=\"g-body\">This is a global problem. Wages are not rising as fast as expected in many countries, especially Britain, France, the Netherlands and Norway.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n    </div>&#13;\n&#13;\n    &#13;\n&#13;\n    &#13;\n      <div class=\"g-item g-text \">&#13;\n    &#13;\n&#13;\n      <p class=\"g-body\">A fundamental refashioning of the labor market has been underway for two decades. Jobs that require middle-range skills have been declining, while those involving skills at both the lower and higher end of the spectrum have been growing. This effectively suppresses wages for many: People in lower-paid, lower-skill jobs \u2014 retail workers, janitors and home health aides \u2014 have little bargaining power to demand higher wages. Middle-skilled workers \u2014 including clerks, call center operators and factory workers \u2014 are being replaced by computers, robots and lesser-paid hands in low-wage countries. Higher-skilled workers are capturing an outsized share of pay.</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n    </div>&#13;\n&#13;\n    &#13;\n&#13;\n    &#13;\n      <div class=\"g-item g-text \">&#13;\n    &#13;\n&#13;\n      <p class=\"g-body\">Union membership has been declining in much of the developed world.

Thenceforth, the Spanish government embarked on legal, police, and administrative persecution of any \u201cdevice or instrument that is to be used for preparing or holding the referendum\u201d, including ballot boxes and papers which were now criminal objects. Websites, apps and tools related with the referendum were closed on the Internet.</p>\n<p>Independently of whether one agrees or disagrees with the decision of the Spanish courts to ban the referendum, the closing of many regular Internet spaces can be viewed, in a great number of cases, as a grave violation of freedom of expression \u2014and especially freedom of political opinion\u2014 which is protected in international treaties and by <a href=\"http://www.europarl.europa.eu/charter/pdf/text_en.pdf#page=11\" target=\"_blank\">Article 11</a> of the European Union\u2019s Charter of Fundamental Rights on \u201cFreedom of expression and information\u201d. While some websites, apps and domains belong to the Generalitat (Government) of Catalonia and were tools directly linked with organizing the referendum, many others were of private individuals or associations, and basically reflect political opinions. It is clear that one thing \u2014arguable or not\u2014 is banning a referendum and quite another is <strong>blocking, while they were at it, the right to express one\u2019s political opinio</strong>n that the referendum should be held.</p>\n<p>In the last few days, Catalonia has been the testing ground of what we have always denounced or, in other words, the fact that the space of the Internet has yet again been subjected to a state of exception which \u201cdemocratic\u201d governments wouldn\u2019t dare to apply to physical space because this violation of rights would immediately be visible. Proof of this is that many of the shut-down websites belong to associations with physical premises but no authority has risked ordering that these centers should be closed.</p>\n<p>Internet access is essential for the exercise of our freedoms and should be considered in itself a fundamental right [<a href=\"https://www.accessnow.org/keepiton/\" target=\"_blank\">#KeepItOn</a>].</p>\n<blockquote><p>If we let the space of the Internet become the first casualty in the curtailment of basic rights, we can be sure that the next step will be to limit those rights in other spaces as well.</p></blockquote>\n<h3>September 13, 2017</h3>\n<p>On September 13 a court order <a href=\"http://www.catalannews.com/politics/item/catalan-government-opens-new-referendum-website-after-original-is-shut-down-by-spain\" target=\"_blank\">shut down the web page <em>referendum.cat</em></a>. Thus began a game of cat-and-mouse between the Spanish government (with its state repression) and the Catalan government. </p>\n<p>Some citizens published the referendum web code in Github. After this, clones of the website began to appear, created by volunteer citizens in domains with names like <em>piolin.cat</em> (where piolin refers to Tweetie Pie, painted on the boat accommodating Spanish police), <em>referendum.ninja</em> o <em>marianorajoy.cat</em>, while alternative sites were also made available by the Generalitat itself. The police operation continues with domains being shut down and access blocked to all these sites as well as many other web pages with opinions about the referendum, including those of associations, sports clubs and private sites. All of this was occurring against a background of politicians being arrested and presidents of civil society associations being charged with sedition.</p>\n<p><strong>In ten days more than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/27/catalans-compare-spain-to-north-korea-after-referendum-sites-blocked)\" target=\"_blank\">140 websites</a> were blocked</strong>. The project <a href=\"https://ooni.torproject.org/post/internet-censorship-catalonia-independence-referendum/\" target=\"_blank\">OONI</a> by Tor includes a non-exhaustive list of affected domains and information on the type of block.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://xnet-x.net/img/dominio-intervenido-a-disposicion-judicial.png\"><img src=\"https://xnet-x.net/img/dominio-intervenido-a-disposicion-judicial.png\" alt=\"dominio-intervenido-a-disposicion-judicial\"/></a></p>\n<p>As part of this state operation,<strong> the Guardia Civil raided the headquarters of Top Level Domain <em>.cat</em></strong>, confiscating IT equipment and data, and detaining one of its IT staff. This disproportionate measure, which is unprecedented in the European Union, implies the possibility of opening the way for something we have been struggling against for years, namely <strong>domain managers being held responsible for content</strong>.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=22176&amp;LangID=E\" target=\"_blank\">UN</a> Rapporteur on Freedom of Opinion and Expression, the <a href=\"https://www.internetsociety.org/news/statements/2017/internet-society-statement-internet-blocking-measures-catalonia-spain/\" target=\"_blank\">Internet Society</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/09/cat-domain-casualty-catalonian-independence-crackdown\" target=\"_blank\">Electronic Founder Foundation</a>, and many other organizations like our own have condemned this blocking of websites and the inordinate digital repression carried out by the Spanish government just days before the referendum was held, which meant that there was no chance to establish their validity, suitability and legality because they left no time to do so.</p>\n<p><strong>In this situation of persecution and very serious violation of rights</strong>, many people, moved by their convictions and without proper legal advice, have exposed themselves to risks which could have been avoided in some cases, and have left their identities at the mercy of a repressive apparatus that needs scapegoats to justify its actions. The open use of names among the alleged authors of the first mirror sites has meant that the authorities are now boasting that they have rounded up the young perpetrators (<a href=\"http://www.europapress.es/catalunya/noticia-libertad-cargos-13-investigados-clonar-webs-referendum-20170925193606.html\" target=\"_blank\">hasta 14</a>). Some of them face very serious charges like \u201c<a href=\"http://www.eldiario.es/cv/val/policia-proreferendum-Valencia-cabecilla-desobediencia_0_692231117.html\" target=\"_blank\">heading a seditious organization</a>\u201d which, as everyone knows, makes no sense at all in a free, open space like the Internet. These are definitely measures that aim to inflict disproportionate punishment so as to bully and intimidate citizens in an attempt to discourage their intense online activity. </p>\n<p>One of the most common errors made by citizens has been their frequent use of servers with few and poor legal guarantees for the client. A case in point is the insistent use of <em>.cat</em>, which falls under the same laws and rules of the Spainsh <em>.es</em> domain. These come under the control of <em>.es</em>, and therefore the Spanish state, which shows no concern for civil rights, in contrast with other generic domains (<em>.net</em>,<em> .org</em>, <em>.com</em>\u2026) with are overseen by ICANN and other organizations that do respect basic rights.</p>\n<p>We believe that it is important to stress that we shouldn\u2019t need martyrs to prove that our struggles are just. We must make every possible effort to ensure that the people who are struggling for their rights don\u2019t suffer reprisals. In this regard, Xnet has tried to give an overall explanation of how to avoid this and other useful information in a <a href=\"https://xnet-x.net/en/how-to-guide-for-preserving-fundamental-rights-internet/\" target=\"_blank\">Guide</a> that seeks to protect people who work with the Internet from unjust repression. This initiative is part of a set of actions designed by the lawyers and organizations of <a href=\"http://www.lafede.cat/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/consells_legals.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">#SomDefensores</a> to defend basic rights.</p>\n<h2>Net Democracy: Distributed Government</h2>\n<p>We have seen a Generalitat that is competent and farsighted in its online activity but, in particular, we also note that the acceleration of events in Catalonia has catalyzed the population into a massive use of digital tools in defense of their basic rights. Unlike similar situations, such as that in Turkey for example, the Catalan institutions have agreed in recent days to <strong>cede and share, in a widely distributed manner, responsibility for safeguarding freedoms</strong>, thus regularizing what we see as the embryo of what could be a <strong>truly transversal democracy worthy of the digital age</strong>, as some of us have already proposed in our discussion of the methodology of the device <a href=\"https://partidox.org/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Red Ciudadana Partido X</a>.</p>\n<p>The president of Catalonia, Carles Puigdemont\u2014thanks also to help from <a href=\"https://www.vilaweb.cat/noticies/els-hackers-que-van-fer-possible-el-cens-universal/\" target=\"_blank\">experts</a> who have actively and continually been engaged in working for the defense of rights (even people like Julian Assange and Peter Sunde publicly offered their counseling)\u2014have recommended the use of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KRLS/status/909126641145798656\" target=\"_blank\">proxies</a> in social networks in order to gain access to blocked websites. He subsequently announced that <em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/KRLS/status/911482634789953536\" target=\"_blank\">IPFS</a></em> had also been used as a distributed tool for housing the website giving citizens information about where they should go to vote.</p>\n<h3>September 23, 2017</h3>\n<p>On September 23, the <a href=\"http://www.elmundo.es/cataluna/2017/09/23/59c69496468aeb8c7f8b45bb.html\" target=\"_blank\">High Court of Justice of Catalonia ordered</a> the \u201c<em><strong>blocking of websites and domains [giving this information] which are publicized in any account or official social network of any kind</strong></em>\u201d (). This was not just a matter of a specific list of sites but a general order giving a free hand to forces of security in ordering Internet providers to shut down websites.</p>\n<p>With these new powers, the Guardia Civil blocked the domain <em>gateway.ipfs.io</em> and thereby cut off connection, not only to the referendum website, but also to all content from the Spanish state <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AlexHinojo/status/911900292152791041\" target=\"_blank\">hosted in IPFS</a> through this gateway. The shutdown extended to websites of nongovernmental organizations and movements like <em>empaperem.cat</em>, <em>assemblea.cat</em> and <em>webdelsi.cat</em> which are in favor of the referendum. This carrying out of the court order also extended to GooglePlay, which was forced to withdraw the app allowing people to find information about where to vote.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, <strong>at all times the whole population of Catalonia has been able to keep informed about polling stations</strong> thanks to continuous <strong>replication and massive use of VPN and anonymous browsing</strong> in order to access sites that were blocked from Spain. This capacity for <strong>action distributed between the government and organized citizens</strong> has been the trend throughout the electoral process, with large-scale use of chats, networks and other tools that have allowed swift circulation of information circulated on the micro-scale and among strangers who are working together to deal with hoaxes, leaks and infiltrations. </p>\n<p>This <strong>networked action</strong> by means of which people have, for example, organized themselves, polling station by polling station, has also been manifest in physical spaces, for example with regard to <a href=\"http://www.ara.cat/tema_del_dia/referendum-Que-gestar-se-Elna_0_1880212030.html\" target=\"_blank\">protecting the ballot boxes</a> from police seizure. For a month, the state security forces and their secret services have been searching all over Catalonia for the ballot boxes and voting papers. Although they have raided printers, media offices and headquarters of political parties and other organizations \u2014sometimes without a court order\u2014 <strong>the ballot boxes were never found, yet they magically appeared in the polling stations</strong>. The ballot boxes and papers were there\u2014they were everywhere\u2014guarded by <strong>small groups, autonomous nodes</strong>, and spread all around Catalonia.</p>\n<h3>October 1, referendum day</h3>\n<p>Finally, even as the referendum was taking place on October 1, the Spanish government tried to block, by every means it could, the possibility of accessing the \u201cuniversal census\u201d app of the entire electoral register.</p>\n<p>The domain <em>registremeses.com</em> where the app was hosted was immediately blocked. The Generalitat quickly supplied the more than 1,000 polling stations throughout Catalonia with alternative IPs for access. We believe that, in this case, it probably would have been better to work with Hidden Service in order to avoid police harassment and DDoS attacks by groups opposing the referendum.<br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.ara.cat/tema_del_dia/Violencia-tambe-digital-contra-referendum_0_1880212015.html\" target=\"_blank\">Internet connection was also interrupted</a> and it is not yet known who is responsible. Could it have been Internet suppliers obeying state orders (although they deny it)?</p>\n<p>However, the polling stations still managed to function, almost all of them routing the smartphones of the volunteers in order to access the Internet.<strong> In the street, people were chorusing \u201cairplane mode\u201d</strong> so as to save network bandwidth for people working inside the polling stations. The operation lasted from 5 a.m.\u2014which is when citizens began filling the streets to protect the polling stations\u2014until midnight when the vote count ended. All this was achieved in the midst of violent charges by National Police with a toll of more than 800 wounded. Despite everything, more than 2,200,000 people came out to vote.</p>\n<h2>Order is the people, equal to equal: disorder is this state and its violence</h2>\n<blockquote><p>The citizens and government of Catalonia have learned and are witnesses to the fact that in the front line of defense of our democracy, digital resistance depends on our use of technological tools which allow us to protect our rights autonomously and in a well distributed manner.</p></blockquote>\n<p>We hope that the Catalan government will never forget this and that its administration will always resist the temptation of the usual kind of discourse that criminalizes tools protecting privacy, encryption and decentralization of the Internet. </p>\n<p>Moreover, when repression was massively unleashed in streets and villages of Catalonia, the social networks and their intelligent use by citizens were once again used to put an end to the blocking and manipulation of information by the mainstream media in Spain, and to let the international media outlets know what was really happening. Perhaps in 2017, many people were already used to this, but it is also highly possible that there have never been so many published videos and photographs documenting <a href=\"https://twitter.com/joncstone/status/914450692416397312\" target=\"_blank\">police violence</a> as there have been this time (https://twitter.com/joncstone/status/914450692416397312). Without the widespread use of social networks to testify and inform, the people of Catalonia would have been totally isolated and crushed with absolute impunity.</p>\n<p>From this point of view, what has been happening in the last few days is historic. This acceleration towards a greater degree of democracy and more power in civil society is happening spontaneously but the ignorance of most people about some aspects of the digital milieu is exposing them to risks and, in this regard, this is what we must make and what we are <a href=\"https://xnet-x.net/en/how-to-guide-for-preserving-fundamental-rights-internet/\" target=\"_blank\">putting evey effort into</a> to achieve.</p>\n<h3>October 1, 2017 as a beginning</h3>\n<p>On October 1, 2017 the politicians were nowhere to be seen. <strong>Only <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unidos_Podemos\" target=\"_blank\">Unidos Podemos</a> could be heard now-and-then, trying to capitalize on our wounded for its own ends. Apart this, there were only grassroots people organizing and acting</strong>, including some members of parliament and councilors who are people like anyone else. Over 24 hours, civil society came together to work for a day in which people could vote and vote on a huge scale and, furthermore, it didn\u2019t fall into the temptation of responding to the state\u2019s provocation in the form of violence, even though hundreds of injured people needed medical attention. There was happiness, anger and fraternity among the most different people. It was incredibly moving. There were no slogans, no shouting, so that people could vote without being coerced in <strong>this display of a valiant, stirring capacity for organization and desire for democracy</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>On October 1, 2017 we proved that order is the people and disorder is this state. </strong><br/>\n\u00a0</p>\n<p><em><strong>Xnet</strong></em></p>\n<p>\u00a0<br/>\n<em>*Front picture by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Makrakas/status/914410446647693312\" target=\"_blank\">@Makrakas</a> in Gr\u00e0cia, Barcelona.</em><br/>\n\u00a0</p>\n<div>\n<em>More info provided by the network:</em>\n<p>Association for Progressive Communications (APC) press release:<br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.apc.org/en/pubs/apc-calls-end-restrictions-freedom-expression-catalonia\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.apc.org/en/pubs/apc-calls-end-restrictions-freedom-expression-catalonia</a></p>\n<p>Netcommons.eu press release:<br/>\n<a href=\"https://netcommons.eu/?q=content/internet-censorship-and-blockade-catalonia-self-sovereign-internet-infrastructures\" target=\"_blank\">https://netcommons.eu/?q=content/internet-censorship-and-blockade-catalonia-self-sovereign-internet-infrastructures</a></p>\n<p>ISOC (Frederic Donc from Brussels) declaration:<br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.internetsociety.org/news/statements/2017/internet-society-statement-internet-blocking-measures-catalonia-spain/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.internetsociety.org/news/statements/2017/internet-society-statement-internet-blocking-measures-catalonia-spain/</a></p>\n<p>Wikipedia article that describes the operation from the Spanish government:<br/>\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Anubis\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Anubis</a></p>\n<p>Official web site of the High Court of Justice of Catalonia:<br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.poderjudicial.es/cgpj/es/Poder-Judicial/Tribunales-Superiores-de-Justicia/TSJ-Cataluna/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.poderjudicial.es/cgpj/es/Poder-Judicial/Tribunales-Superiores-de-Justicia/TSJ-Cataluna/</a></p>\n<p>The legal basis in Catalonia comes from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Catalonia\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Catalonia</a> and several laws approved such as: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_on_the_Referendum_on_Self-determination_of_Catalonia\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_on_the_Referendum_on_Self-determination_of_Catalonia</a> and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_juridical_transition_and_foundation_of_the_Republic\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_juridical_transition_and_foundation_of_the_Republic</a>.</p>\n<p>The informative web site www.referendum.cat (Sept 13) was blocked by police with a judicial order to suspend the DNS domain:<br/>\n<a href=\"https://blog.cdmon.com/ca/comunicat-oficial-referendum-cat/\" target=\"_blank\"> https://blog.cdmon.com/ca/comunicat-oficial-referendum-cat/</a></p>\n<p>Replicas of this web site were hosted in Cloudflare, but then ISPs were ordered filters or redirections.</p>\n<p>The site was published in a code repository and replicated in the P2P file system IPFS.

We are\u00a0acutely aware of that now. There\u2019s a definite attitude to make more than just the natural progression as far as efficiency,\u201d Lenz said, noting state officials monitor pumping and determine how many acres owners can irrigate.</p>\n<aside class=\"related right\"/>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re constantly trying to find ways to stay in compliance,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at serious conservation.\u201d</p>\n<p>For years, agriculture experts have pointed to drip-irrigation technology to do more with less.\u00a0 Federal agencies in the past dangled help for farmers who invest. But few in eastern Colorado have installed these systems, largely because they are expensive.</p>\n<p>Farmer and cattleman Robert Boyd, a leader of the Arikaree Groundwater Management District, said the federal government should intervene to ensure survival of High Plains agriculture.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you want us to be sustainable? Or not? It may come to a point where no one can actually irrigate,\u201d Boyd said.</p>\n<p>He pointed to proposals to divert water from the Missouri River Basin and move it westward through pipelines across the Great Plains.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf the federal government wants agriculture to be sustainable, they need to pump water back toward the mountains. They need to figure out how to get water back toward the higher parts of the rivers,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cThe federal government needs to step in and make the states work together to make agriculture \u2014 and urban areas \u2014 sustainable.\u201d</p>\n<p>For now, farmers struggle, increasingly weighing water uncertainties in calculations that include corn prices falling to around $3.50 a bushel in recent years from $7. But drawing down the aquifer does not violate any law in Colorado. The state engineer\u2019s office monitors well levels and requires permits for wells, limiting the number of acres a farmer can irrigate. But there\u2019s no hard limit on how much water can be pumped.</p>\n<p>In contrast, state rules limit <a href=\"http://www.denverpost.com/2011/04/26/south-denver-suburbs-preparing-to-end-reliance-on-super-deep-wells/\">groundwater withdrawals from the Denver Basin Aquifer</a>\u00a0\u2014 a source for many of Denver\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.denverpost.com/2014/12/09/denver-suburbs-drawing-down-groundwater-aim-for-renewable-supply/\">southern suburbs,</a> including Castle Rock and Parker \u2014 to less than 1 percent a year.

In the rural view, it is a problem that cannot be addressed by farmers alone without help from people in cities. All of the industrial\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.denverpost.com/2017/03/05/gravel-pit-colorado-farmers-agriculture/\">agriculture is done with urban residents in mind \u2014 the people who consume the crops and cows that farmers grow</a>.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe world population is going to double. And we\u2019re not going to be able to grow more farmland. We\u2019re losing farming ground every day to development,\u201d said Cody Powell, manager of 21st Century Equipment, the John Deere dealer in Burlington, an agricultural hub.\u00a0\u201cYou take away farm ground for development, bring in more people. Who\u2019s going to feed them? The only way to do that is to put water on crops.\u201d</p>\n<p>People in cities increasingly demand environmentally correct crops, which requires more water. \u201cIf they want natural grain-fed cattle, and non-GMO (genetically modified organism) crops \u2014 all that good stuff \u2014 it is going to take water,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>A farmer can grow more by using pesticides and genetically modified seeds, he said. \u201cWith the same amount of water, you could get twice as much corn.\u201d</p>\n<p>He knows too well the perils of <a href=\"http://www.denverpost.com/2011/03/11/colorado-farmland-goes-dry-as-suburbs-secure-water-supplies/\">losing water. He grew up in southern Colorado\u2019s Arkansas River Valley</a> at a time when Aurora and other Front Range suburbs were buying up rights from farmers. This buy-up to slake growing suburban thirsts ended up killing agriculture across hundreds of thousands of once-irrigated acres.</p>\n<p>And now when Powell goes back, he sees communities \u201coverrun with thugs\u201d near where his grandmother lived. \u201cIt makes me feel sick,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>In eastern Colorado, the problem now is that <a href=\"http://www.denverpost.com/2015/08/01/colorado-farmers-grow-more-food-on-less-water-amid-rising-competition/\">few can afford to invest in high-efficiency water technology, such as irrigation drip tubes and tape installed underground to eliminate evaporation losses, and soil-sensor systems that let farmers irrigate only when absolutely necessary</a>.</p>\n<p>Federal programs to subsidize installation of this technology have withered. And the overpumping continues.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe fear out here now is not that the aquifer is going to get ruined,\u201d Powell said. \u201cThe fear is that the state is going to shut off wells.\u201d</p>\n<p>And prairie residents practically cringe to see the pipeline northeast of Wray that Colorado uses to convey groundwater away to Nebraska and Kansas to prevent future lawsuits.</p>\n<p>The interstate compact was negotiated back when there was more water and far fewer people, they say.</p>\n<p>\u201cNow we just have weeds. We are feeling the effect of losing the water that Kansas is enjoying,\u201d Scott said from her farmhouse. \u201cIt is robbing families of life. That\u2019s what is happening to us. We should be entitled to the\u00a0water underground.\u201d</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_2811940\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter size-article_inline\"><img class=\" lazyautosizes lazyload\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/dryland_water_2017_rj_27068.jpg?w=620&amp;crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C9999px\" alt=\"A single stock of corn stands ...\" data-src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/dryland_water_2017_rj_27068.jpg?w=620&amp;crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C9999px\" data-srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/dryland_water_2017_rj_27068.jpg?w=620&amp;crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C9999px 620w,https://i2.wp.com/www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/dryland_water_2017_rj_27068.jpg?w=780&amp;crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C9999px 780w,https://i2.wp.com/www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/dryland_water_2017_rj_27068.jpg?w=810&amp;crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C9999px 810w,https://i2.wp.com/www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/dryland_water_2017_rj_27068.jpg?w=630&amp;crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C9999px 630w\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><p class=\"photo-credit\">RJ Sangosti, The Denver Post</p>A single stock of corn stands in a field, in Yuma County, after harvest on Sept. 12, 2017 in Idalia.</figcaption></figure>\n<h3>Past becomes future</h3>\n<p>The depletion means water scarcity increasingly dictates survival.</p>\n<p>It is no surprise to\u00a0historians. In the 1860s, John Wesley Powell\u2019s surveys for the U.S. government warned that the land west of central Kansas was practically a desert. His report \u201cOn the Arid Lands of the Western United States\u201d warned that the only way for people to live here would be by irrigating land. Otherwise, he wrote, the place could not support permanent communities. Tribes for centuries used the Great Plains seasonally as a hunting ground.</p>\n<p>Settlers flocked in during the 19th century, initially relying on dryland farming. This led to massive soil erosion, culminating in the Dust Bowl environmental disaster of the 1930s.</p>\n<p>Industrial irrigation took off during the 1960s, with tens of thousands of wells drilled through the 1980s.</p>\n<p>But now, if people keep pumping, the dry-out will intensify, CSU senior research scientist Kevin Bestgen said.</p>\n<p>\u201cI appreciate it that people now are trying to reduce pumping. The reality is that the bucket they are pumping from does not refill. It is finite. And in order to allow recharge of that aquifer,\u00a0farmers are going to have to get much more severe reductions in pumping levels. It has been going down and down and down,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cPeople are getting what they can. This will turn out to be a tragedy. It is in the culture at this point. People want to grow corn now.\u201d</p>\n<hr/>\n<h3>Groundwater levels</h3>\n<p>The map shows the change in groundwater levels for various management districts in the Northern High Plains Basin over the last 10 years.

I don&#x27;t see anything shocking about choosing a buyback over the other two choices. After all, when a company takes investor money in a public offering, the idea is that the money will eventually be returned to investors, plus a profit if possible. A buyback is one way to close out the deal with some of those investors and return that money.<p>Edit:<p>Also, I think there&#x27;s a bit of funny math here possibly contributing to a misunderstanding when the article says things like this:<p>&gt; During that period those companies used 54% of their earnings\u2014a total of $2.4 trillion\u2014to buy back their own stock, almost all through purchases on the open market. Dividends absorbed an additional 37% of their earnings.

Yet most Americans are not sharing in the recovery. While the top 0.1% of income recipients\u2014which include most of the highest-ranking corporate executives\u2014reap almost all the income gains, good jobs keep disappearing, and new employment opportunities tend to be insecure and underpaid. Corporate profitability is not translating into widespread economic prosperity.</span></p>\n<p>The allocation of corporate profits to stock buybacks deserves much of the blame. Consider the 449 companies in the S&amp;P 500 index that were publicly listed from 2003 through 2012. During that period those companies used 54% of their earnings\u2014a total of $2.4 trillion\u2014to buy back their own stock, almost all through purchases on the open market. Dividends absorbed an additional 37% of their earnings. That left very little for investments in productive capabilities or higher incomes for employees.</p>\n<p>The buyback wave has gotten so big, in fact, that even shareholders\u2014the presumed beneficiaries of all this corporate largesse\u2014are getting worried. \u201cIt concerns us that, in the wake of the financial crisis, many companies have shied away from investing in the future growth of their companies,\u201d Laurence Fink, the chairman and CEO of BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, wrote in an open letter to corporate America in March. \u201cToo many companies have cut capital expenditure and even increased debt to boost dividends and increase share buybacks.\u201d</p>\n<p>Why are such massive resources being devoted to stock repurchases? Corporate executives give several reasons, which I will discuss later. But none of them has close to the explanatory power of this simple truth: Stock-based instruments make up the majority of their pay, and in the short term buybacks drive up stock prices. In 2012 the 500 highest-paid executives named in proxy statements of U.S. public companies received, on average, $30.3 million each; 42% of their compensation came from stock options and 41% from stock awards. By increasing the demand for a company\u2019s shares, open-market buybacks automatically lift its stock price, even if only temporarily, and can enable the company to hit quarterly earnings per share (EPS) targets.</p>\n<p>As a result, the very people we rely on to make investments in the productive capabilities that will increase our shared prosperity are instead devoting most of their companies\u2019 profits to uses that will increase their own prosperity\u2014with unsurprising results. Even when adjusted for inflation, the compensation of top U.S. executives has doubled or tripled since the first half of the 1990s, when it was already widely viewed as excessive. Meanwhile, overall U.S. economic performance has faltered.</p>\n<p>If the U.S. is to achieve growth that distributes income equitably and provides stable employment, government and business leaders must take steps to bring both stock buybacks and executive pay under control. The nation\u2019s economic health depends on it.</p>\n<h2>From Value Creation to Value Extraction</h2>\n<p>For three decades I\u2019ve been studying how the resource allocation decisions of major U.S. corporations influence the relationship between <em>value creation</em> and <em>value extraction,</em> and how that relationship affects the U.S. economy. From the end of World War II until the late 1970s, a <em>retain-and-reinvest</em> approach to resource allocation prevailed at major U.S. corporations. They retained earnings and reinvested them in increasing their capabilities, first and foremost in the employees who helped make firms more competitive. They provided workers with higher incomes and greater job security, thus contributing to equitable, stable economic growth\u2014what I call \u201csustainable prosperity.\u201d</p>\n<p>This pattern began to break down in the late 1970s, giving way to a <em>downsize-and-distribute</em> regime of reducing costs and then distributing the freed-up cash to financial interests, particularly shareholders. By favoring value extraction over value creation, this approach has contributed to employment instability and income inequality. \n </p>\n<p>As documented by the economists Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez, the richest 0.1% of U.S. households collected a record 12.3% of all U.S. income in 2007, surpassing their 11.5% share in 1928, on the eve of the Great Depression. In the financial crisis of 2008\u20132009, their share fell sharply, but it has since rebounded, hitting 11.3% in 2012.</p>\n<p>Since the late 1980s, the largest component of the income of the top 0.1% has been compensation, driven by stock-based pay. Meanwhile, the growth of workers\u2019 wages has been slow and sporadic, except during the internet boom of 1998\u20132000, the only time in the past 46 years when real wages rose by 2% or more for three years running. Since the late 1970s, average growth in real wages has increasingly lagged productivity growth. (See the exhibit \u201cWhen Productivity and Wages Parted Ways.\u201d)</p>\n\n<article-sidebar class=\"article-sidebar sidebar--half\" data-sidebar-alternate=\"sidebar\">\n \n <div class=\"sidebar-contents height--collapse\">\n  <p>From 1948 to the mid-1970s, increases in productivity and wages went hand in hand. Then a gap opened between the two.</p> \n   \n   \n </div>\n</article-sidebar>\n<p>Not coincidentally, U.S. employment relations have undergone a transformation in the past three decades. Mass plant closings eliminated millions of unionized blue-collar jobs. The norm of a white-collar worker\u2019s spending his or her entire career with one company disappeared. And the seismic shift toward offshoring left all members of the U.S. labor force\u2014even those with advanced education and substantial work experience\u2014vulnerable to displacement.</p>\n<p>To some extent these structural changes could be justified initially as necessary responses to changes in technology and competition. In the early 1980s permanent plant closings were triggered by the inroads superior Japanese manufacturers had made in consumer-durable and capital-goods industries. In the early 1990s one-company careers fell by the wayside in the IT sector because the open-systems architecture of the microelectronics revolution devalued the skills of older employees versed in proprietary technologies. And in the early 2000s the offshoring of more-routine tasks, such as writing unsophisticated software and manning customer call centers, sped up as a capable labor force emerged in low-wage developing economies and communications costs plunged, allowing U.S. companies to focus their domestic employees on higher-value-added work.</p>\n<p>These practices chipped away at the loyalty and dampened the spending power of American workers, and often gave away key competitive capabilities of U.S. companies. Attracted by the quick financial gains they produced, many executives ignored the long-term effects and kept pursuing them well past the time they could be justified.</p>\n<p>A turning point was the wave of hostile takeovers that swept the country in the 1980s. Corporate raiders often claimed that the complacent leaders of the targeted companies were failing to maximize returns to shareholders. That criticism prompted boards of directors to try to align the interests of management and shareholders by making stock-based pay a much bigger component of executive compensation.</p>\n<p>Given incentives to maximize shareholder value and meet Wall Street\u2019s expectations for ever higher quarterly EPS, top executives turned to massive stock repurchases, which helped them \u201cmanage\u201d stock prices. The result: Trillions of dollars that could have been spent on innovation and job creation in the U.S. economy over the past three decades have instead been used to buy back shares for what is effectively stock-price manipulation.</p>\n<h2>Good Buybacks and Bad</h2>\n<p>Not all buybacks undermine shared prosperity. There are two major types: tender offers and open-market repurchases. With the former, a company contacts shareholders and offers to buy back their shares at a stipulated price by a certain near-term date, and then shareholders who find the price agreeable tender their shares to the company. Tender offers can be a way for executives who have substantial ownership stakes and care about a company\u2019s long-term competitiveness to take advantage of a low stock price and concentrate ownership in their own hands. This can, among other things, free them from Wall Street\u2019s pressure to maximize short-term profits and allow them to invest in the business. Henry Singleton was known for using tender offers in this way at Teledyne in the 1970s, and Warren Buffett for using them at GEICO in the 1980s. (GEICO became wholly owned by Buffett\u2019s holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, in 1996.) As Buffett has noted, this kind of tender offer should be made when the share price is below the intrinsic value of the productive capabilities of the company and the company is profitable enough to repurchase the shares without impeding its real investment plans. \n </p>\n<p>But tender offers constitute only a small portion of modern buybacks. Most are now done on the open market, and my research shows that they often come at the expense of investment in productive capabilities and, consequently, aren\u2019t great for long-term shareholders.</p>\n<p>Companies have been allowed to repurchase their shares on the open market with virtually no regulatory limits since 1982, when the SEC instituted Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act. Under the rule, a corporation\u2019s board of directors can authorize senior executives to repurchase up to a certain dollar amount of stock over a specified or open-ended period of time, and the company must publicly announce the buyback program. After that, management can buy a large number of the company\u2019s shares on any given business day without fear that the SEC will charge it with stock-price manipulation\u2014provided, among other things, that the amount does not exceed a \u201csafe harbor\u201d of 25% of the previous four weeks\u2019 average daily trading volume. The SEC requires companies to report total quarterly repurchases but not daily ones, meaning that it cannot determine whether a company has breached the 25% limit without a special investigation.</p>\n<article-promo class=\"article-promo promo--half\"> \n <h4>Further Reading</h4> \n <div class=\"promo-contents\"> \n  <ul> \n   <li>\n    <figure class=\"mbm\"> \n     <img src=\"/resources/images/article_assets/2014/10/46Jun14_Mukunda_price-of-wall-streets-power1.jpg\"/> \n    </figure>  \n    <div class=\"stream-item-info\"> \n     <span class=\"topic\">Economics</span> \n     <span class=\"content-type\">Feature</span> \n      \n      \n     <p class=\"mvm\"> \n      <span class=\"dek\">The financialization of the economy has serious downsides.</span> \n     </p> \n     <stream-item class=\"stream-item\" data-id=\"tag:hbr.org,1922-01-01:201406.43680-R1406D\" data-title=\"The Price of Wall Street's Power\" data-url=\"/2014/06/the-price-of-wall-streets-power/ar/1\" data-topic=\"Economics\" data-image=\"/resources/images/article_assets/2014/10/46Jun14_Mukunda_price-of-wall-streets-power1.jpg\" data-summary=\"The financialization of the economy has serious downsides.\" data-authors=\"Gautam Mukunda\" data-content-type=\"Magazine Article\" data-item-selectable=\"false\" data-item-activity=\"false\"> \n       \n     </stream-item> \n    </div> </li> \n  </ul> \n </div>\n</article-promo>\n<p>Despite the escalation in buybacks over the past three decades, the SEC has only rarely launched proceedings against a company for using them to manipulate its stock price. And even within the 25% limit, companies can still make huge purchases: Exxon Mobil, by far the biggest stock repurchaser from 2003 to 2012, can buy back about $300 million worth of shares a day, and Apple up to $1.5 billion a day. In essence, Rule 10b-18 legalized stock market manipulation through open-market repurchases.</p>\n<p>The rule was a major departure from the agency\u2019s original mandate, laid out in the Securities Exchange Act in 1934. The act was a reaction to a host of unscrupulous activities that had fueled speculation in the Roaring \u201920s, leading to the stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression. To prevent such shenanigans, the act gave the SEC broad powers to issue rules and regulations.</p>\n<p>During the Reagan years, the SEC began to roll back those rules. The commission\u2019s chairman from 1981 to 1987 was John Shad, a former vice chairman of E.F. Hutton and the first Wall Street insider to lead the commission in 50 years. He believed that the deregulation of securities markets would channel savings into economic investments more efficiently and that the isolated cases of fraud and manipulation that might go undetected did not justify onerous disclosure requirements for companies. The SEC\u2019s adoption of Rule 10b-18 reflected that point of view.</p>\n\n<h2>Debunking the Justifications for Buybacks</h2>\n<p>Executives give three main justifications for open-market repurchases. Let\u2019s examine them one by one:</p>\n<h3>1. Buybacks are investments in our undervalued shares that signal our confidence in the company\u2019s future.</h3>\n<p>This makes some sense. But the reality is that over the past two decades major U.S. companies have tended to do buybacks in bull markets and cut back on them, often sharply, in bear markets. (See the exhibit \u201cWhere Did the Money from Productivity Increases Go?\u201d) They buy high and, if they sell at all, sell low. Research by the Academic-Industry Research Network, a nonprofit I cofounded and lead, shows that companies that do buybacks never resell the shares at higher prices.</p>\n<article-sidebar class=\"article-sidebar sidebar--half\" data-sidebar-alternate=\"sidebar\">\n \n <div class=\"sidebar-contents height--collapse\">\n  <p>Buybacks\u2014as well as dividends\u2014have skyrocketed in the past 20 years. (Note that these data are for the 251 companies that were in the S&amp;P 500 in January 2013 and were public from 1981 through 2012. Inclusion of firms that went public after 1981, such as Microsoft, Cisco, Amgen, Oracle, and Dell, would make the increase in buybacks even more marked.) Though executives say they repurchase only undervalued stocks, buybacks increased when the stock market boomed, casting doubt on that claim.</p> \n   \n  <p class=\"credit\"> \n   <span class=\"sourcebody\"><span class=\"sourcebody\"><span class=\"sourcelabel\">Source:</span> Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s Compustat database; the Academic-Industry Research Network. <br/><span class=\"sourcelabel\">Note:</span> Mean repurchase and dividend amounts are in 2012 dollars.</span></span>\n  </p> \n </div>\n</article-sidebar>\n<p>Once in a while a company that bought high in a boom has been forced to sell low in a bust to alleviate financial distress. GE, for example, spent $3.2 billion on buybacks in the first three quarters of 2008, paying an average price of $31.84 per share. Then, in the last quarter, as the financial crisis brought about losses at GE Capital, the company did a $12 billion stock issue at an average share price of $22.25, in a failed attempt to protect its triple-A credit rating. \n </p>\n<p>In general, when a company buys back shares at what turn out to be high prices, it eventually reduces the value of the stock held by continuing shareholders. \u201cThe <em>continuing</em> shareholder is penalized by repurchases above intrinsic value,\u201d Warren Buffett wrote in his 1999 letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders. \u201cBuying dollar bills for $1.10 is not good business for those who stick around.\u201d</p>\n<h3>2. Buybacks are necessary to offset the dilution of earnings per share when employees exercise stock options.</h3>\n<p>Calculations that I have done for high-tech companies with broad-based stock option programs reveal that the volume of open-market repurchases is generally a multiple of the volume of options that employees exercise. In any case, there\u2019s no logical economic rationale for doing repurchases to offset dilution from the exercise of employee stock options. Options are meant to motivate employees to work harder now to produce higher future returns for the company. Therefore, rather than using corporate cash to boost EPS immediately, executives should be willing to wait for the incentive to work. If the company generates higher earnings, employees can exercise their options at higher stock prices, and the company can allocate the increased earnings to investment in the next round of innovation.</p>\n<h3>3. Our company is mature and has run out of profitable investment opportunities; therefore, we should return its unneeded cash to shareholders.</h3>\n<p>Some people used to argue that buybacks were a more tax-efficient means of distributing money to shareholders than dividends. But that has not been the case since 2003, when the tax rates on long-term capital gains and qualified dividends were made the same. Much more important issues remain, however: What is the CEO\u2019s main role and his or her responsibility to shareholders?</p>\n<p>Companies that have built up productive capabilities over long periods typically have huge organizational and financial advantages when they enter related markets. One of the chief functions of top executives is to discover new opportunities for those capabilities. When they opt to do large open-market repurchases instead, it raises the question of whether these executives are doing their jobs.</p>\n<p>A related issue is the notion that the CEO\u2019s main obligation is to shareholders. It\u2019s based on a misconception of the shareholders\u2019 role in the modern corporation. The philosophical justification for giving them all excess corporate profits is that they are best positioned to allocate resources because they have the most interest in ensuring that capital generates the highest returns. This proposition is central to the \u201cmaximizing shareholder value\u201d (MSV) arguments espoused over the years, most notably by Michael C. Jensen. The MSV school also posits that companies\u2019 so-called free cash flow should be distributed to shareholders because only they make investments without a guaranteed return\u2014and hence bear risk.</p>\n<article-sidebar class=\"article-sidebar sidebar--half\" data-sidebar-alternate=\"sidebar\">\n \n <div class=\"sidebar-contents height--collapse\">\n  <p>Since the early 1980s, when restrictions on open-market buybacks were greatly eased, distributions to shareholders have absorbed a huge portion of net income, leaving much less for reinvestment in companies.</p> \n  <p><a rel=\"highslide\" href=\"/resources/images/article_assets/hbr/1409/R1409B_C_LG.gif\" title=\"Click here for a larger image\" class=\"article-image highslide\"><img src=\"/resources/images/article_assets/hbr/1409/R1409B_C.gif\"/></a> </p>\n  <p class=\"credit\"> \n   <span class=\"sourcebody\"><span class=\"sourcebody\"><span class=\"sourcelabel\">Note:</span> Data are for the 251 companies that were in the S&amp;P 500 Index in January 2013 and were publicly listed from 1981 through 2012. If the companies that went public after 1981, such as Microsoft, Cisco, Amgen, Oracle, and Dell, were included, repurchases as a percentage of net income would be even higher.</span></span>\n  </p> \n </div>\n</article-sidebar>\n<p>But the MSV school ignores other participants in the economy who bear risk by investing without a guaranteed return. <em>Taxpayers</em> take on such risk through government agencies that invest in infrastructure and knowledge creation. And <em>workers</em> take it on by investing in the development of their capabilities at the firms that employ them. As risk bearers, taxpayers, whose dollars support business enterprises, and workers, whose efforts generate productivity improvements, have claims on profits that are at least as strong as the shareholders\u2019.</p>\n<p>The irony of MSV is that public-company shareholders typically never invest in the value-creating capabilities of the company at all. Rather, they invest in outstanding shares in the hope that the stock price will rise. And a prime way in which corporate executives fuel that hope is by doing buybacks to manipulate the market. The only money that Apple ever raised from public shareholders was $97 million at its IPO in 1980. Yet in recent years, hedge fund activists such as David Einhorn and Carl Icahn\u2014who played absolutely no role in the company\u2019s success over the decades\u2014have purchased large amounts of Apple stock and then pressured the company to announce some of the largest buyback programs in history.</p>\n<p>The past decade\u2019s huge increase in repurchases, in addition to high levels of dividends, have come at a time when U.S. industrial companies face new competitive challenges. This raises questions about how much of corporate cash flow is really \u201cfree\u201d to be distributed to shareholders. Many academics\u2014for example, Gary P. Pisano and Willy C. Shih of Harvard Business School, in their 2009 HBR article <a href=\"/2009/07/restoring-american-competitiveness/ar/1\">\u201cRestoring American Competitiveness\u201d </a> and their book <span class=\"mediatitle\"><a href=\"/product/producing-prosperity-why-america-needs-a-manufacturing-renaissance/an/10345E-KND-ENG\">Producing Prosperity</a></span>\u2014have warned that if U.S. companies don\u2019t start investing much more in research and manufacturing capabilities, they cannot expect to remain competitive in a range of advanced technology industries. \n </p>\n<p>Retained earnings have always been the foundation for investments in innovation. Executives who subscribe to MSV are thus copping out of their responsibility to invest broadly and deeply in the productive capabilities their organizations need to continually innovate. MSV as commonly understood is a theory of value extraction, not value creation.</p>\n<h2>Executives Are Serving Their Own Interests</h2>\n<p>As I noted earlier, there is a simple, much more plausible explanation for the increase in open-market repurchases: the rise of stock-based pay. Combined with pressure from Wall Street, stock-based incentives make senior executives extremely motivated to do buybacks on a colossal and systemic scale.</p>\n<p>Consider the 10 largest repurchasers, which spent a combined $859 billion on buybacks, an amount equal to 68% of their combined net income, from 2003 through 2012. (See the exhibit \u201cThe Top 10 Stock Repurchasers.\u201d) During the same decade, their CEOs received, on average, a total of $168 million each in compensation. On average, 34% of their compensation was in the form of stock options and 24% in stock awards. At these companies the next four highest-paid senior executives each received, on average, $77 million in compensation during the 10 years\u201427% of it in stock options and 29% in stock awards. Yet since 2003 only three of the 10 largest repurchasers\u2014Exxon Mobil, IBM, and Procter &amp; Gamble\u2014have outperformed the S&amp;P 500 Index.</p>\n<article-sidebar class=\"article-sidebar sidebar--half\" data-sidebar-alternate=\"sidebar\">\n \n <div class=\"sidebar-contents height--collapse\">\n  <p>At most of the leading U.S. companies below, distributions to shareholders were well in excess of net income. These distributions came at great cost to innovation, employment, and\u2014in cases such as oil refining and pharmaceuticals\u2014customers who had to pay higher prices for products.</p> \n  <p><a rel=\"highslide\" href=\"/resources/images/article_assets/hbr/1409/R1409B_D_LG.gif\" title=\"Click here for a larger image\" class=\"article-image highslide\"><img src=\"/resources/images/article_assets/hbr/1409/R1409B_D.gif\"/></a></p> \n  <p><a rel=\"highslide\" href=\"/resources/images/article_assets/hbr/1409/R1409B_E_LG.gif\" title=\"Click here for a larger image\" class=\"article-image highslide\"><img src=\"/resources/images/article_assets/hbr/1409/R1409B_E.gif\"/></a> </p>\n  <p class=\"credit\"> \n   <span class=\"sourcebody\"><span class=\"sourcebody\"><span class=\"sourcelabel\">Sources:</span> Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s Compustat database; Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s Execucomp database; the Academic-Industry Research Network. <span class=\"sourcelabel\"><br/>Note:</span> The percentages of stock-based pay include gains realized from exercising stock options for all years plus, for 2003\u20132005, the fair value of restricted stock grants or, for 2006\u20132012, gains realized on vesting of stock awards. Rounding to the nearest billion may affect total distributions and percentages of net income. *Steven Ballmer, Microsoft\u2019s CEO from January 2000 to February 2014, did not receive any stock-based pay. He does, however, own about 4% of Microsoft\u2019s shares, valued at more than $13 billion.</span></span>\n  </p> \n </div>\n</article-sidebar>\n<h2>Reforming the System</h2>\n<p>Buybacks have become an unhealthy corporate obsession. Shifting corporations back to a retain-and-reinvest regime that promotes stable and equitable growth will take bold action. Here are three proposals:</p>\n<h3>Put an end to open-market buybacks.</h3>\n<p>In a 2003 update to Rule 10b-18, the SEC explained: \u201cIt is not appropriate for the safe harbor to be available when the issuer has a heightened incentive to manipulate its share price.\u201d In practice, though, the stock-based pay of the executives who decide to do repurchases provides just this \u201cheightened incentive.\u201d To correct this glaring problem, the SEC should rescind the safe harbor.</p>\n<p>A good first step toward that goal would be an extensive SEC study of the possible damage that open-market repurchases have done to capital formation, industrial corporations, and the U.S. economy over the past three decades. For example, during that period the amount of stock taken out of the market has exceeded the amount issued in almost every year; from 2004 through 2013 this net withdrawal averaged $316 billion a year. In aggregate, the stock market is not functioning as a source of funds for corporate investment. As I\u2019ve already noted, retained earnings have always provided the base for such investment. I believe that the practice of tying executive compensation to stock price is undermining the formation of physical and human capital.</p>\n<h3>Rein in stock-based pay.</h3>\n<p>Many studies have shown that large companies tend to use the same set of consultants to benchmark executive compensation, and that each consultant recommends that the client pay its CEO well above average. As a result, compensation inevitably ratchets up over time. The studies also show that even declines in stock price increase executive pay: When a company\u2019s stock price falls, the board stuffs even more options and stock awards into top executives\u2019 packages, claiming that it must ensure that they won\u2019t jump ship and will do whatever is necessary to get the stock price back up.</p>\n<p>In 1991 the SEC began allowing top executives to keep the gains from immediately selling stock acquired from options. Previously, they had to hold the stock for six months or give up any \u201cshort-swing\u201d gains. That decision has only served to reinforce top executives\u2019 overriding personal interest in boosting stock prices. And because corporations aren\u2019t required to disclose daily buyback activity, it gives executives the opportunity to trade, undetected, on inside information about when buybacks are being done. At the very least, the SEC should stop allowing executives to sell stock immediately after options are exercised. Such a rule could help launch a much-needed discussion of meaningful reform that goes beyond the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act\u2019s \u201cSay on Pay\u201d\u2014an ineffectual law that gives shareholders the right to make nonbinding recommendations to the board on compensation issues. \n </p>\n<p>But overall the use of stock-based pay should be severely limited. Incentive compensation should be subject to performance criteria that reflect investment in innovative capabilities, not stock performance.</p>\n<h3>Transform the boards that determine executive compensation.</h3>\n<p>Boards are currently dominated by other CEOs, who have a strong bias toward ratifying higher pay packages for their peers. When approving enormous distributions to shareholders and stock-based pay for top executives, these directors believe they\u2019re acting in the interests of shareholders.</p>\n<article-promo class=\"article-promo promo--half\">\n <figure class=\"left small-6 mrl\"> \n </figure> \n <h4>Further Reading</h4> \n <div class=\"promo-contents\"> \n   \n  <div class=\"stream-item-info\"> \n   <span class=\"topic\">Corporate Governance</span> \n   <span class=\"content-type\">Feature</span> \n    \n    \n   <p class=\"mvm dek\">\n    Steps for making capitalism stronger, more resilient, more innovative, and more equitable.\n   </p> \n  </div> \n </div> \n <stream-item class=\"stream-item\" data-id=\"tag:hbr.org,1922-01-01:201103.47907-R1103F\" data-title=\"Capitalism for the Long Term\" data-url=\"/2011/03/capitalism-for-the-long-term/ar/1\" data-topic=\"Corporate Governance\" data-image=\"\" data-summary=\"Steps for making capitalism stronger, more resilient, more innovative, and more equitable.\" data-authors=\"Dominic Barton\" data-content-type=\"Magazine Article\" data-item-selectable=\"false\" data-item-activity=\"false\"> \n   \n </stream-item>\n</article-promo>\n<p>That\u2019s a big part of the problem. The vast majority of shareholders are simply investors in outstanding shares who can easily sell their stock when they want to lock in gains or minimize losses. As I argued earlier, the people who truly invest in the productive capabilities of corporations are taxpayers and workers. Taxpayers have an interest in whether a corporation that uses government investments can generate profits that allow it to pay taxes, which constitute the taxpayers\u2019 returns on those investments. Workers have an interest in whether the company will be able to generate profits with which it can provide pay increases and stable career opportunities.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s time for the U.S. corporate governance system to enter the 21st century: Taxpayers and workers should have seats on boards. Their representatives would have the insights and incentives to ensure that executives allocate resources to investments in capabilities most likely to generate innovations and value.</p>\n<h2>Courage in Washington</h2>\n<p>After the Harvard Law School dean Erwin Griswold published \u201cAre Stock Options Getting out of Hand?\u201d in this magazine in 1960, Senator Albert Gore launched a campaign that persuaded Congress to whittle away special tax advantages for executive stock options. After the Tax Reform Act of 1976, the compensation expert Graef Crystal declared that stock options that qualified for the capital-gains tax rate, \u201conce the most popular of all executive compensation devices\u2026have been given the last rites by Congress.\u201d It also happens that during the 1970s the share of all U.S. income that the top 0.1% of households got was at its lowest point in the past century.</p>\n<p>The members of the U.S. Congress should show the courage and independence of their predecessors and go beyond \u201cSay on Pay\u201d to do something about excessive executive compensation. In addition, Congress should fix a broken tax regime that frequently rewards value extractors as if they were value creators and ignores the critical role of government investment in the infrastructure and knowledge that are so crucial to the competitiveness of U.S. business.</p>\n<p>Instead, what we have now are corporations that lobby\u2014often successfully\u2014for federal subsidies for research, development, and exploration, while devoting far greater resources to stock buybacks. Here are three examples of such hypocrisy:</p>\n<h3>Alternative energy.</h3>\n<p>Exxon Mobil, while receiving about $600 million a year in U.S. government subsidies for oil exploration (according to the Center for American Progress), spends about $21 billion a year on buybacks. It spends virtually no money on alternative energy research. \n </p>\n<article-promo class=\"article-promo promo--half\">\n  \n  \n</article-promo>\n<p>Meanwhile, through the American Energy Innovation Council, top executives of Microsoft, GE, and other companies have lobbied the U.S. government to triple its investment in alternative energy research and subsidies, to $16 billion a year. Yet these companies had plenty of funds they could have invested in alternative energy on their own. Over the past decade Microsoft and GE, combined, have spent about that amount annually on buybacks.</p>\n<h3>Nanotechnology.</h3>\n<p>Intel executives have long lobbied the U.S. government to increase spending on nanotechnology research. In 2005, Intel\u2019s then-CEO, Craig R. Barrett, argued that \u201cit will take a massive, coordinated U.S. research effort involving academia, industry, and state and federal governments to ensure that America continues to be the world leader in information technology.\u201d Yet from 2001, when the U.S. government launched the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI), through 2013 Intel\u2019s expenditures on buybacks were almost four times the total NNI budget.</p>\n<h3>Pharmaceutical drugs.</h3>\n<p>In response to complaints that U.S. drug prices are at least twice those in any other country, Pfizer and other U.S. pharmaceutical companies have argued that the profits from these high prices\u2014enabled by a generous intellectual-property regime and lax price regulation\u2014permit more R&amp;D to be done in the United States than elsewhere. Yet from 2003 through 2012, Pfizer funneled an amount equal to 71% of its profits into buybacks, and an amount equal to 75% of its profits into dividends. In other words, it spent more on buybacks and dividends than it earned and tapped its capital reserves to help fund them. The reality is, Americans pay high drug prices so that major pharmaceutical companies can boost their stock prices and pad executive pay.<span class=\"contextchange\">Given the importance of the stock market and corporations to the economy and society, U.S. regulators must step in to check the behavior of those who are unable or unwilling to control themselves. \u201cThe mission of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission,\u201d the SEC\u2019s website explains, \u201cis to protect investors, maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitate capital formation.\u201d Yet, as we have seen, in its rulings on and monitoring of stock buybacks and executive pay over three decades, the SEC has taken a course of action contrary to those objectives. It has enabled the wealthiest 0.1% of society, including top executives, to capture the lion\u2019s share of the gains of U.S. productivity growth while the vast majority of Americans have been left behind. Rule 10b-18, in particular, has facilitated a rigged stock market that, by permitting the massive distribution of corporate cash to shareholders, has undermined capital formation, including human capital formation.</span></p>\n<p>The corporate resource allocation process is America\u2019s source of economic security or insecurity, as the case may be. If Americans want an economy in which corporate profits result in shared prosperity, the buyback and executive compensation binges will have to end.

The <i>Mona Lisa</i>\u2019s smile came not from some divine intervention. Instead, it was the product of years of painstaking and studied human effort involving applied science as well as artistic skill. Using his technical and anatomical knowledge, Leonardo generated the optical impressions that made possible this brilliant display of virtuosity. In doing so, he showed how the most-profound examples of creativity come from embracing both the arts and the sciences.</p><p class=\"dropcap\"><span class=\"smallcaps\">Leonardo\u2019s efforts to </span>fashion the <i>Mona Lisa</i>\u2019s effects began with the preparation of the painting\u2019s wood panel. On a thin-grained plank cut from the center of a trunk of poplar, he applied a primer coat of lead white, rather than just a mix of chalk and pigment. That undercoat, he knew, would be better at reflecting back the light that made it through his fine layers of translucent glazes and thereby would enhance the impression of depth, luminosity, and volume.</p><p>Some of the light that penetrates the layers of paint reaches the white undercoat and is reflected back through those same layers. As a result, our eyes see the interplay between the light rays that bounce off the colors on the surface and those that dance back from the depths of the painting. This creates shifting and elusive subtleties. The contours of Lisa\u2019s cheeks and smile are created by soft transitions of tone that seem veiled by the glaze layers, and they vary as the light in the room and the angle of our gaze change. The painting comes alive.</p><figure><picture><img alt=\"\" data-srcset=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2017/09/WEL_Isaacson_MonaLisa_Web_Mona/5a75b76e9.jpg\" class=\"lazyload\"/></picture><figcaption class=\"credit\">Photograph: Dennis Hallinan / Alamy</figcaption></figure><p>Like 15th-century Netherlandish painters such as Jan van Eyck, Leonardo used glazes that had a very small proportion of pigment mixed into the oil. Leonardo\u2019s distinctive approach was to apply the glaze in extraordinarily thin and tiny strokes and then very slowly, over months and sometimes years, apply additional layer upon thin layer. This permitted him to create forms that looked three-dimensional, show subtle gradations in shadows, and blur the borders of objects in a sfumato style. His strokes were so light and layered that many individual brushstrokes are imperceptible.</p></section><p class=\"ad-boxinjector-wrapper\"><gpt-ad id=\"boxinjector2\" targeting-pos=\"boxinjector2\" class=\"ad ad-boxinjector\" lazy-load=\"2\" data-object-pk=\"1\" data-object-name=\"boxinjector\"><gpt-sizeset viewport-size=\"[0, 0]\" sizes=\"[[300, 250], [320, 350], [300, 350], [1, 3], [320, 520], [320, 430], [1, 4], [1, 1], [1, 5]]\"/><gpt-sizeset viewport-size=\"[760, 0]\" sizes=\"[[728, 90], [728, 350], [1, 3], [768, 350], [768, 520], [640, 360], [760, 350], [1, 4], [1, 5]]\"/><gpt-sizeset viewport-size=\"[1010, 0]\" sizes=\"[[728, 90], [728, 350], [970, 250], [1, 3], [768, 350], [768, 520], [640, 360], [970, 350], [760, 350], [1, 4], [1, 5]]\"/><gpt-sizeset viewport-size=\"[1050, 0]\" sizes=\"[[728, 90], [728, 350], [970, 250], [1024, 350], [1, 3], [1600, 520], [1000, 350], [1600, 500], [970, 350], [760, 350], [1, 4], [1, 5]]\"/></gpt-ad></p><section id=\"article-section-4\"><p>For the shadows that form the contours of Lisa\u2019s face and especially around her smile, he pioneered the use of an iron-and-manganese mix to create a pigment that was burnt umber in color. \u201cThe thickness of a brown glaze placed over the pink base of the <i>Mona Lisa</i>\u2019s cheek grades smoothly from just 2\u20135 micrometers to around thirty micrometers in the deepest shadow,\u201d according to <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v466/n7307/pdf/466694a.pdf\" data-omni-click=\"r'article',r'link',r'3',r'540636'\">a <i>Nature</i> article</a> about a recent study using X-ray-fluorescence spectroscopy.

This led him to a discovery that any of us could make on our own, but it is a testament to Leonardo\u2019s keen power of observation that he noticed it when most of us don\u2019t: Because we pucker our lips by contracting the muscle that forms the lower lip, we can pucker both lips at the same time or the lower lip alone, but we cannot pucker our top lip alone.

The lips peek out of the page directly at us with just a hint\u2014flickering and haunting and alluring\u2014of a mysterious smile. Even though the fine lines at the ends of the mouth turn down almost imperceptibly, the impression is that the lips are smiling. Here amid the anatomy drawings we find the makings of the <i>Mona Lisa</i>\u2019s smile.</p><p class=\"dropcap\"><span class=\"smallcaps\">Another piece of science</span> that augments the <i>Mona Lisa</i>\u2019s smile comes from Leonardo\u2019s research on optics: He realized that light rays do not come to a single point in the eye, but instead hit the whole area of the retina. The central area of the retina, known as the fovea, has closely packed cones and is best at seeing small details; the area surrounding the fovea is best at picking up shadows and shadings of black and white. When we look at an object straight on, it appears sharper. When we look at it peripherally, glimpsing it with the corner of our eye, it is a bit blurrier, as if it were farther away.</p><p>With this knowledge, Leonardo was able to create an interactive smile, one that is elusive if we are too intent on seeing it. The fine lines at the corners of Lisa\u2019s mouth show a small downturn\u2014just like the mouth floating atop the anatomy sheet. If you stare directly at the mouth, the retina catches these tiny details and delineations, making her appear not to be smiling. But if you move your gaze slightly away, to look at her eyes or cheeks or some other part of the painting, you will catch sight of her mouth only peripherally. It will be a bit blurrier. The tiny delineations at the corners of the mouth become indistinct, but you will still see the shadows at her mouth\u2019s edge. These shadows and the soft sfumato at the edge of her mouth make her lips seem to turn upward into a subtle smile.

I learned a few things from that.</p>\n<p>When I was a resident, two thirtysomething family docs had an office upstairs from the residency program. Ned and Peter precepted us, and they sometimes ran downstairs to ask the director, Dr. Pete, for his input when they had a tough case themselves.</p>\n<p>It was very clear to me that Ned and Peter had a shared vision of how a practice should run, even though I\u2019m sure they weren\u2019t clones of each other. They also seemed to be really in tune with the residency, and one of them later became its director.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-118444\"/></p>\n<p>My first job after graduation was with two middle-aged doctors in a small Maine mill town. They covered seamlessly for each other, even though they seemed like very different people. I realized quickly that my comfort level with some of the things they tackled in the hospital was never going to catch up with theirs, so I moved on to where I am now the medical director. I did express my discomfort with handling patients in the intensive care unit, for example, and they did tell me they were considering giving it up, but not right away. I was their employee, and although they offered me a partnership, they were the majority and the founding partners.</p>\n<p>The clinic where I ended up spending most of my career is very different, and very typical for medical practices today. We are a nonprofit organization with a board and a chief executive officer. I may be the medical director, but the physicians and nurse practitioners here really answer more to the CEO than to me.</p>\n<p>The providers here are a little like my one-time herd of five cats, gathered under one roof by circumstance rather than from a clear and particular desire to work with each other. Sure, Dr. Brown was my doctor when he worked in the city many years ago, and he came here in part because he knew me, and Dr. Kim had practiced in the next town over and had been curious about us. He did call and talk to me before going very far in negotiations with our CEO, just to make sure he\u2019d fit in, but others came here because of our location or some other reason besides knowing that we would all work well together or that we shared some deep practice philosophy.</p>\n<p>We are not a group practice in the sense that group practices were formed when I started out. So my job as medical director is a lot more like herding cats than leading a group of like-minded visionaries in the early days of the new specialty of family practice. Also, because I care for a full compliment of patients alongside my colleagues and depend on their coverage and cooperation, I am in no position to be heavy-handed in leading our medical staff. I may work to set an example in some cases, by building consensus in others, but I seldom lay down commandments on stone tablets.</p>\n<p>That is a stark contrast to Elijah Lamb at Cityside Medical Group. At his hospital owned mega practice, he isn\u2019t just the medical director, but a hospital vice-president of medical affairs. He is more clearly in the chain of command, and his medical staff knows it. He even fires people.</p>\n<p>Right now, a newly hired provider at my clinic is asking that we not contradict her antibiotic stewardship when she sees another provider\u2019s patient for a bronchitis. I did a \u201cpractice style inventory\u201d several months ago, and we all said we didn\u2019t prescribe antibiotics for a bronchitis of fewer than seven days duration. But Karen knows we often do, and she feels we undercut her by giving in to patients that call us the day after seeing her.</p>\n<p>We have also had several exchanges and meetings about how we handle opioid prescriptions. When one of my colleagues reduced her hours in semiretirement, Dr. Kim inherited many of her patients, and started tapering some off their opiates. Much unrest followed. We had to sit down to find common ground about whether patients could switch from Dr. Kim to another provider just to see if they would reinstate their opioids. We decided, along with our CEO, not to allow internal transfers of that nature. Anything else would likely tear apart the fabric of our group, we reasoned. Interestingly, the retiring physician told us that the patients Dr. Kim had tapered off opioids were people she herself had contemplated doing the same with. She just hadn\u2019t done it yet.</p>\n<p>Do I wish my job was more like Dr. Lambs? Would I be happy seeing a few token patients and spending the rest of my time being a medical administrator? I don\u2019t think so, no more than I would have preferred not to live with five cats of different disposition.</p>\n<p>As a doctor, I never tell my patients what to do. I outline, explain and support my patients in choosing between options. That is how I act toward my colleagues, too. Just like with integrating five cats, it may not be the quickest way to get things done, but in the big scheme of things, it is the only way that really works if you want peace in your house.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cA Country Doctor\u201d is a family physician who blogs at\u00a0<a href=\"http://acountrydoctorwrites.wordpress.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">A Country Doctor Writes:</a>.</em></p>\n<p><em>Image credit:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.shutterstock.com/?cr=00&amp;pl=edit-00\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Shutterstock.com</a></em></p>\n&#13;\n                &#13;\n                                        &#13;\n                                        &#13;\n                &#13;\n                                &#13;\n                                    &#13;\n                    &#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n                    &#13;\n                    &#13;\n                &#13;\n                &#13;\n                &#13;\n                &#13;\n                <p class=\"swp-content-locator\"/>\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div></body></html>"}, "15429256": {"score": 2, "comments": [], "time": "2017-10-08 21:16:52", "url": "https://www.julian.com/blog/startup-competition?hn", "text": "<html><body><div><div class=\"blog formatted-text w-richtext\"><h2>Why you're stressed</h2><p>For many founders, starting a startup is\u00a0the most stressful thing they\u00a0do <em>in their lifetime</em>. I polled friends\u00a0to identify the sources of that stress: (1) a lack of growth, (2) work/life balance, and (3) <strong>competition</strong>.</p><p>Competition is the outlier because you could argue it's mostly an illusion. It's therefore the easiest one to dispel in a short blog post.</p><p>I've had more than one VC\u00a0tell me they send this post to their founders\u00a0because it's an effective\u00a0therapy session. So hopefully you'll sleep better after reading this \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u0089</p><h3>The anxiety\u00a0of competition</h3><p>Every startup idea I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had has been haunted by these concerns:</p><ul><li>What if the competition appropriates my entire business into a feature? (Facebook does this to a lot of startups.)</li><li>If I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t build my product/feature\u00a0<em>immediately</em>, someone will before me, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have lost this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to get a headstart on press and user adoption.</li><li>What if my competitors' broad market saturation makes it so difficult to entice people to sign up for my product that customer acquisition costs will be unsustainably high?</li></ul><p>Time and time again, these concerns make me seriously question whether a startup is a massive waste of my time. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t use the word \u00e2\u0080\u009cmassive\u00e2\u0080\u009d lightly.\u00a0My fear of wasting time is rooted in my sharp awareness of opportunity cost.</p><p>So, how can we overcome this anxiety? By understanding the lifecycle of a startup.\u00a0</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"\"/><h3>Early stage: You're not unique</h3><p>In the early stage, your approach to market must not be \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are unique.\u00e2\u0080\u009d That's what founders love to tell themselves \u00e2\u0080\u0094 because that's\u00a0the message they successfully used to secure funding and hire a team. </p><p>But it's a toxic mindset that fosters anxiety. Instead, you should think of\u00a0your startup as merely cloning\u00a0existing competitors feature by feature.\u00a0Even if that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not the case,\u00a0tell yourself it is in the early stages of your startup.</p><p>When you embrace this copycat mindset, you reduce the anxiety of having to finish your MVP before someone beats you to market. You also get\u00a0the calming luxury of being a laggard. Laggards have a\u00a0vantage point. They\u00a0can prioritize growth viability (instead of novelty) by examining how existing\u00a0competitors acquire\u00a0users then reflecting those acquisition loops in their MVP.\u00a0</p><p>(<a target=\"_blank\" data-rt-link-type=\"external\" href=\"http://a-fwd.com/fr=juliancom06-21&amp;de=juliancom0c-21&amp;uk=juliancom-21&amp;ca=juliancom0d-20&amp;com=juliandotc059-20&amp;asin-com=1591848369\">Traction</a> is a must-read book for understanding\u00a0growth channels.)</p><p>Examples of laggards include what Slack is to HipChat, what GitHub is to Atlassian, and what Spotify is to Pandora. </p><p>If you cling to the desire to be unique instead of\u00a0embracing the copycat mindset, your pursuit of novelty masks the truth of startup\u00a0viability: if you don't have users, it doesn't matter how novel you are.\u00a0</p><blockquote>\u00e2\u0099\u0096 There are no original ideas. But there are original executions. <br/><br/>\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Luke Wroblewski</blockquote><p>Plus, novelty in the software world only exists in the short-term. Everything you\u00a0do\u00a0will eventually be copied \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and copied better. There is nothing proprietary about bits.</p><h3>... and that frees your mind</h3><p>We just covered the practical benefits to not thinking you're unique. But this\u00a0post is about reducing stress, so we need to cover the abstract benefits as well.</p><p>Consider this: Mentally compress the time horizon of your marketplace's competition into a singular moment that your startup forever\u00a0exists in. In this singularity, every new feature you release is\u00a0instantly copied by everyone else. That's what it means to \"compress the time horizon.\"\u00a0</p><p>In other words, no individual product is\u00a0unique. Consequently,\u00a0the only\u00a0momentum your business experiences is the broadening of the marketplace itself. This benefits both you and your competitors. You're are all in this together; you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re along for a ride and you should be grateful you have a ticket.</p><p>You ultimately wind up working with these companies to increase the overall demand for your collective offering. So you might as well get to know your neighbors and get comfortable seeing them at your doorstep every morning. In the long-run, they're your\u00a0friends, not your foes.</p><p>Once you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve adopted this mindset, you cease to look at the startup hustle as a game of\u00a0one-upping competitors. Instead, you see it as a\u00a0more relaxed process of maintaining your status as a <strong>viable</strong> competitor.\u00a0</p><p>That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a much easier burden to bear. Because, if you are perceptive of what your competitors are doing\u00a0and if you have a competent team working on your product, all you have to do is respond to external demand on a reasonable timeline. You don't have to self-impose artificial time pressure to release novel features.</p><p>And when all your competitors\u00a0are veering toward the same feature set, you can stop worrying\u00a0about quarter-to-quarter fluctuations.</p><p>This is how you approach early-stage startup competition. It not only lessens your anxiety, but it redirects\u00a0your focus into something more productive. This trickles down to everyone in your team.</p><p>But what comes after the short-term? What happens when you're in a cut-throat game of live or die, and your\u00a0funding is drying up? This brings us to our discussion of handling\u00a0<em>mid-stage</em>\u00a0stress.</p><h3>Mid-stage: Focus on retention</h3><p>When you fear competition, you're actually fearing two things in particular: <br/>(1) thinning margins and (2) losing the customers you already have. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s it.\u00a0</p><p>The latter is more\u00a0important. You can't increase margins on customers you don't have. And since the mid-stage of your startup is the point at which you've acquired\u00a0healthy customers, let's discuss\u00a0retention. If we can create a reasonable approach to retention, we can greatly reduce our anxiety of\u00a0losing customers to competition.</p><p>Consider this:\u00a0Once every soul on the planet is either on Facebook or WhatsApp, what's Facebook's\u00a0next focus? Retention, of course.\u00a0Retention is always the final step.\u00a0</p><p>Remember that user growth is not the ultimate goal of a business\u00e2\u0080\u008a\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u008arevenue growth is. When your users stick around, you can experiment with new ways to monetize them.</p><p>So appreciate the importance of retention early in the lifecycle of your startup.</p><h3>Retention reality check</h3><p>It is\u00a0much easier for most startups to improve retention by 5% (e.g. improve customer support and make features more sticky) than it is to increase user adoption by 5% (e.g. spend money on ad buys and spend time on business development).\u00a0</p><p>Just saying \"ad buy\" and \"business development\" probably makes your stomach churn (no pun intended). You know what a risk they can be. Meanwhile, improving <strong>customer support</strong> and making your <strong>product stickier</strong>\u00a0are very straight-forward if you take the time to educate yourself. And there's near-zero risk in trying it.\u00a0</p><p>If you aren't focusing on these two things at the mid-stage, you're mismanaging priorities. For a primer, see\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" data-rt-link-type=\"external\" href=\"http://a-fwd.com/fr=juliancom06-21&amp;de=juliancom0c-21&amp;uk=juliancom-21&amp;ca=juliancom0d-20&amp;com=juliandotc059-20&amp;asin-com=1449335675\">Lean Analytics</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" data-rt-link-type=\"external\" href=\"http://a-fwd.com/fr=juliancom06-21&amp;de=juliancom0c-21&amp;uk=juliancom-21&amp;ca=juliancom0d-20&amp;com=juliandotc059-20&amp;asin-com=0470610123\">Landing Page Optimization</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\" data-rt-link-type=\"external\" href=\"http://a-fwd.com/fr=juliancom06-21&amp;de=juliancom0c-21&amp;uk=juliancom-21&amp;ca=juliancom0d-20&amp;com=juliandotc059-20&amp;asin-com=0307463745\">Rework</a>.</p><p>Not only is a focus on retention less risky, it's also easier:\u00a0You already have well-defined, observable users who want your product\u00e2\u0080\u008a\u00e2\u0080\u0094so \u00e2\u0080\u008athe onus is on you to simply talk with them and react to their concerns appropriately.</p><p>If I\u00a0were to reduce this advice into a quip, it would be:</p><blockquote>\u00e2\u0099\u0096 Effective entrepreneurs aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t concerned about competition; effective entrepreneurs are concerned about users. They look inward, not outward.</blockquote><h3>The power of retention</h3><p>Retention is more important than growth-at-all-costs because a startup with low churn is a startup with\u00a0brand advocates. Brand advocates are\u00a0lifetime users who\u00a0don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t jump ship when a competitor\u00a0introduces a great feature\u00a0you haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t implemented yet.</p><p>The greater the percentage of your userbase that consists of brand advocates, the stickier your business is, and the less you have to stress about competition blindsiding you with something novel.</p><p>Because when a competitor does release something\u00a0game-changing, you simply respond with 1) the appropriate engineering resources and 2) open communication with your users about your product roadmap. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s it.\u00a0There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no difficult validation to work through; the competitor already validated demand\u00a0for you. You can be the laggard who first sees what others did right and wrong.</p><p>(Have you realized yet that I'm describing Apple's approach to market?)</p><p>If you have a product that users depend on and love, they won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t disappear the instant a competitor one-ups you. Not even 4 weeks later. Not even 3 months later.\u00a0Maybe 6+ months later if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve utterly failed to respond to your changing market.\u00a0</p><p>But several months is a heck of a lot of leeway. And, if you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t rise to the occasion, then you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a slow-moving beast who's either the market\u00e2\u0080\u0099s old guard\u00a0or the stubborn upstart that will succumb to a slow death.</p><p>And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a critical concept that entrepreneurs fearing competition fail to realize:\u00a0<strong>Startups don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t die by being blindsided. They die\u00a0<em>slow deaths</em>.</strong>\u00a0That should be tremendously comforting, because it means you no longer have to be on high alert when you wake up every morning\u00a0or throughout your weekends and vacations; instead, you just have to ensure you never bury your head in the sand for too long.</p><p>Here's the crux of my argument:\u00a0</p><blockquote>\u00e2\u0099\u0096 Appreciating that you always have work to do but never work you must\u00a0do\u00a0<em>immediately</em>\u00a0affords you the peace of mind needed to enjoy\u00a0life while pursuing the startup hustle.</blockquote><p>We're almost done. What's left is understanding the power of long-term retention.</p><h3>Long term: Focus on brand</h3><p>To focus on your brand is to double\u00a0down on retention. It's taking retention from the tangible (product improvements) to the abstract (brand affinity).</p><p>My favorite quote from <a data-rt-link-type=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://a-fwd.com/fr=juliancom06-21&amp;de=juliancom0c-21&amp;uk=juliancom-21&amp;ca=juliancom0d-20&amp;com=juliandotc059-20&amp;asin-com=0804139296\">Zero to One</a>\u00a0is,\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll companies inherently have monopolies over their brands.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00a0Essentially, Airbnb will forever be the only \u00e2\u0080\u009cAirbnb.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Slack will forever be the only \"Slack.\"</p><p>Consequently, whatever you decide to have your brand stand for is not something that competing brands can ever take away from you. They can only copy you, and they will likely fail when they try because users become jaded when they see blatant mimicry.</p><p>Building off our discussion on retention, the goal with brand ownership is to hone it until you reach a point where your users would feel miserable if they had to deal with your competitor instead. You want them to feel like they would be replacing a part of their identity:\u00a0They would cease to be \"the guy who constantly wears Nike's\" or \"the girl who tells everyone to use Slack.\"\u00a0</p><p>You need your startup to get to the point where when a competitor adds an amazing feature, your users say, \"Damn, that's insanely cool! But... I'm just going to wait until [startup] offers this. Hopefully it's soon, but if they don't, I'll figure out a compromise.\"</p><p><a data-rt-link-type=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eepurl.com/ci0ZR5\">MailChimp</a>\u00a0is an example of a strong brand.

When strong competitors arise, how many of MailChimp\u00e2\u0080\u0099s users do you think are going to jump ship in the short-term? Almost zero.</p><h3>What you need to remember</h3><blockquote>\u00e2\u0099\u0096 Overcome anxiety by focusing on the most pressing\u00a0aspects of your startup given where it is in\u00a0its lifecycle.</blockquote><ul><li>Your company is not unique. Never allow yourself to think that. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re simply expanding a marketplace that numerous competitors partake in. Your competition is a living organism that will adapt just like you do; they will always exist in some form.</li><li>Retention is king: Every day, fight to carve out a piece of the market that you can call home. A home is where users love to stay.\u00a0Homes don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t grow fast because families (employees and users) don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t grow fast, but\u00e2\u0080\u008a\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u008acrucially\u00e2\u0080\u008a\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u008ahealthy families never fade away.

Instead, the botched project risks becoming a poster child for government mismanagement.</p>\n<p>The nation's biggest-ever infrastructure investment has turned into a political football, plagued by cost overruns and construction delays.</p>\n<p>With the network years behind the original schedule and only about half finished, Australia has slumped to 50th place on a global ladder of internet speeds, behind Kenya and a string of former Soviet bloc nations. Public frustration with the project is boiling over amid mounting criticism that politics is trumping policy across a host of areas from housing to energy and damaging Australia's economic prospects.</p>\n<p>\"We are really an example of how not to do it,\" said Paul Budde, a Sydney-based former adviser to the United Nations on the social and economic benefits of digital development. \"We have ended up with the worst possible solution.\" </p>\n<p class=\"A300-placeholder collapse\"/><p>The network was conceived as a high-speed platform to increase economic output and beam state-of-the-art health and education services to remote corners of the country. The cost of failure would be stark.</p>\n<p>With a substandard internet backbone, it's tougher for workers to move from major cities and ease pressure on house prices in Sydney and Melbourne. It becomes harder to boost productivity, which the central bank says must improve to avoid a decline in living standards.</p>\n<p>Ian Martin, a telecommunications analyst at New Street Research in Melbourne, says the network will never generate enough revenue to recoup its cost and a writedown of between A$20 billion and A$30 billion -- about half the price of its construction -- is inevitable.</p>\n<p class=\"S300-placeholder collapse\"/><p>\"It will never be a success financially, not in terms of ever getting the money back that's been spent on it,\" said Martin. \"To do it as a nationalized government monopoly was clearly the wrong way to go.\"</p>\n<p>The NBN, as the national broadband network project is known, is a story of state intervention, political ambition and a ballooning bill for taxpayers. It sparked a mixture of excitement and skepticism from the outset. </p>\n<p>In 2009, Kevin Rudd's then-Labor government pledged to weave almost every home and business into a fiber-optic network by 2017 at a cost of A$43 billion, with bundles of glass threads transporting an explosion of digital information.</p>\n<p>From the outset, some questioned the economics of using such technology in one of the world's most-sparsely populated countries. During a visit to Sydney in 2010, Mexican telecommunications billionaire Carlos Slim said the bill was too high for the number of homes the network would connect.</p>\n<p>As the 2013 election loomed, the opposition Liberal-National coalition attacked the project -- with its communications spokesman Malcolm Turnbull the chief critic. He proposed assorted technologies to drive down costs, including using existing copper wires to connect premises to a local hub or node, instead of bringing the more expensive fiber-optic cables all the way to a home.</p>\n<p>Turnbull is now prime minister and the blueprint he pledged to complete for A$29.5 billion has boomeranged to plague him. The bill has soared to between A$47 billion and A$51 billion and the network won't be complete until 2020, according to NBN Co., the state-owned company charged with rolling it out.</p>\n<p>\"The whole thing's been a political football from the start,\" said John Hewson, who led the Liberals in the early 1990s and is now a professor at Canberra's Australian National University. \"The governments are the masters of their own demise on the NBN.\"</p>\n<p>The company is straight-jacketed by the government's insistence on a financial return from the network, even though as a wholesaler NBN Co. can't sell directly to the public and set the final price of a connection.</p>\n<p>NBN Co. says it's aiming to increase annual revenue more than five-fold to A$5.4 billion and be cash flow positive in 2021.</p>\n<p>While retailers have complained they're being charged too much to access the network, NBN Chief Executive Officer Bill Morrow has accused them of a \"land grab\" for customers while minimizing capacity purchases. That's led to peak-hour crunches that have left many users complaining of dropouts when using streaming services such as Netflix.</p>\n<p>As customers switch over to the NBN, frustration with download speeds is boiling over, with complaints to the telecommunications ombudsman more than doubling to 7,512 in the second half of 2016 from a year earlier. NBN argues that complaints rose as more people connected to the network.</p>\n<p>Exasperation at a lack of information, coverage holes, service dropouts and delays at being connected were common among the almost 200 public submissions to a 2017 parliamentary inquiry.</p>\n<p>Among them is Louise Degeling, a retired bookkeeper who lives a little more than an hour's drive north of Sydney on the Central Coast. NBN told Degeling in February 2016 her home was ready to go. She's now been told she might have to wait until 2020.</p>\n<p>\"I jumped up and down, I screamed and yelled and got myself into an awful angst,\" said Degeling. \"Whoever designed this piece of rubbish needs to be held to account.\" She has given up hope of getting on the NBN and is using a wireless broadband device instead.</p>\n<p>To be sure, Morrow says NBN will ultimately be \"on the right side of history.\" As the former Vodafone Group executive released his latest business plan in August, he said the network was more than fast enough for most users and can be upgraded to meet demand for higher speeds.</p>\n<p>\"NBN has hit its operational targets for the last 13 reporting quarters -- we are on track to complete the project as promised in 2020,\" NBN said in an email. The network's mix of technologies has allowed it to start delivering services and recouping taxpayer funds much sooner than would have been possible under a nationwide fiber rollout, NBN said.</p>\n<p>Much of the public debate has centered on the choice of technology, pitting Labor's original fiber-to-the-home proposal versus Turnbull's fiber-to-the-node -- where about 40 percent of homes will rely on copper for the final connection.</p>\n<p>Budde, whose career as a telecommunications consultant spans four decades, says the copper network has such a short life expectancy that the government will have to spend billions of dollars next decade upgrading the wires to fiber. Good money after bad, says Budde, who formerly advised Stephen Conroy when he was Labor communications minister overseeing the NBN.</p>\n<p>Last week, the Australian parliamentary inquiry's report into the NBN called for an independent audit of the project's business case and recommended that fiber be used where possible for the rest of the rollout.</p>\n<p>Fiber internet connections in Asia outnumber any other high-speed alternative more than two to one, while developing nations are also skipping older technologies and opting for fiber, according to a UN agency.</p>\n<p>Australia risks missing the next wave of digital innovation as businesses that need faster web connections head overseas, said Matt Barrie, chief executive officer of Freelancer Ltd., the Sydney-based job-outsourcing company that has about 25 million users worldwide.</p>\n<p>\"They're going to all sprout up and grow in Silicon Valley or across Asia and you literally won't even be able to access the services here, let alone start the companies that provide those services,\" said Barrie.</p>\n\n\n    </div>\n\n        </div></body></html>"}, "15430001": {"score": 3, "comments": ["The people who can&#x27;t fathom a future without theit precious iDevices are doomed to suffer the same fate as Blackberry.

This is why, for example, there are no template deduction guides, even if they would make for a nicer interface when dealing with character sets.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"#installation\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\" id=\"user-content-installation\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"octicon octicon-link\" version=\"1.1\" viewbox=\"0 0 16 16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"/></svg></a>Installation</h2>\n<p>Abulafia is a headers-only library.

Central Idea</h2>\n<p>Logistic regressions, decision trees, SVMs, neural networks etc have a set of structural choices that one must make before actually fitting the model parameters. For example, within the logistic regression family, you can build separate models using either L1 or L2 regularization penalties. Within the decision tree family, you can have different models with different structural choices such as the depth of the tree, pruning thresholds, or even the splitting criteria. These structural choices are called hyperparameters.</p>\n<p>Taditionally, for a datascientist, building a classification model is an iterative process of coming up with the model, tweak the hyperparameters and test it using test data.

Kelly said it functioned well before that time.</p><p class=\"story-continued\">Story Continued Below</p>\n\n  <p>Although many of Trump\u2019s high-profile meetings with lawmakers and potential Cabinet members before his inauguration occurred in New York at Trump Tower, much of his transition staff worked out of the office space about three blocks from the White House.</p> \n<p>Officials have tried to determine whether Kelly signed onto an insecure wireless network there or whether a hacker, foreign government or some other outside force could have accessed the phone there. </p> \n<p>\"That's where it seems to have started,\" one White House official with knowledge of the review said. The official said the transition building was only one possible site for the breach.

Now, that might be a voter that normally votes Democrat,\" he says. Parscale says the campaign would average 50-60,000 different ad versions every day, some days peaking at 100,000 separate iterations \u2013 changing design, colors, backgrounds and words \u2013 all in an effort to refine ads and engage users.</p><p>Parscale received help utilizing Facebook's technology from Facebook employees provided by the company who showed up for work to his office multiple days a week. He says they had to be partisan and he questioned them to make sure.\u00a0 \"I wanted people who supported Donald Trump.\"\u00a0 Parscale calls these Facebook employees \"embeds\" who could teach him every aspect of the technology. \"I want to know everything you would tell Hillary's campaign plus some,\" he says he told them.</p><p>Both campaigns used Facebook's advertising technology extensively to reach voters, but Parscale says the Clinton campaign didn't go as far as using \"embeds.\" \"I had heard that they did not accept any of [Facebook's] offers.\"</p><p>The conservative Parscale sees an irony in all this. \"These social platforms are all invented by very liberal people on the West and East Coast.\u00a0 And we figure out how to use it to push conservative values.

This is a feature of\nphp's <a href=\"http://php.net/manual/de/function.parse-ini-file.php\">parse<em>ini</em>file</a>.</p>\n<p>So something like this in e.g. an <code>/etc/php.d/environment.ini</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"ini language-ini\" data-lang=\"ini\"><span class=\"na\">memory_limit</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s\">${PHP_MEMORY_LIMIT}</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>is possible. If you set <code>PHP_MEMORY_LIMIT</code> to <code>2048M</code> in your docker-compose's <code>environment</code> or any of those <code>env_file</code>s,\nit will work.</p>\n<h2><code>fastcgi_param</code> in nginx.conf</h2>\n<p>Even if you might not want to modify your php image, you will usually have a custom nginx.conf in your nginx image.</p>\n<p>So whenever you pass your php requests to a fastcgi handler/upstream, you can use:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"text language-text\" data-lang=\"text\">fastcgi_param PHP_VALUE \"memory_limit=2G\\nsession.save_handler=memcache\";\nfastcgi_param PHP_ADMIN_VALUE \"open_basedir=off\";\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>in nginx\u00e2\u0080\u0098s <code>conf</code>-files. Remember that setting this once for a php fastcgi process will keep the config also for the\nnext requests. Thus use it never or always for the same php fpm pool.</p>\n<p>Using environment variables is not built-in nginx. But if you have lua enabled in nginx, you can retrieve a environment\nvariable like this somewhere before nginx\u00e2\u0080\u0098s <code>http</code>:</p>\n\n<p>and the following in a <code>location</code>/<code>server</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"text language-text\" data-lang=\"text\">set_by_lua $PHP_MEMORY_LIMIT 'return os.getenv(\"PHP_MEMORY_LIMIT\")';\nfastcgi_param php_value \"memory_limit=$PHP_MEMORY_LIMIT\u00e2\u0080\u009c;\n</code></pre></div>\n<h2>.htaccess in apache</h2>\n<p>You can also override the php value in a <code>.htaccess</code> if you are using apache as webserver:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"text language-text\" data-lang=\"text\">php_value memory_limit 256M\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>If you use environment variables here:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"text language-text\" data-lang=\"text\">php_value memory_limit %{ENV:PHP_MEMORY_LIMIT}\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>you can use dockers environment variables again to configure the deployment on demand.</p>\n<h2>.user.ini in fastcgi</h2>\n<p>The fastcgi version of php supports <code>.user.ini</code> files in any of the parent directories.

I spend a week testing the <a href=\"http://releases.ubuntu.com/17.10/\" target=\"_blank\">Beta 2</a> and in this \u201clast minute\u201d review, I document some of the less obvious features/gotchas of Ubuntu 17.10. I also share with you my experience and provide a few workarounds for some problems that I spotted. For a more conventional review, have a look at OMGUbuntu\u2019s excellent <a href=\"http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2017/09/ubuntu-17-10-beta-2-download\" target=\"_blank\">blogpost</a>.</p>\n<h1>1. Bye bye Unity, Hello Gnome</h1>\n<p><img src=\"http://blog.datumbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/ubuntu-17.10.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-846\" srcset=\"http://blog.datumbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/ubuntu-17.10.jpg 750w, http://blog.datumbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/ubuntu-17.10-300x169.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\"/>For those of you who don\u2019t know me, I\u2019m a creature of habit and an Ubuntu fan-boy, so when Canonical announced that they are <a href=\"https://insights.ubuntu.com/2017/04/05/growing-ubuntu-for-cloud-and-iot-rather-than-phone-and-convergence/\" target=\"_blank\">ditching Unity</a> I was not particularly happy. Nevertheless, even though Unity had some great features and it was particularly appealing to me, I find it a bit pointless to try and go against the flow of the river (manually installing Unity 7, using one of the community forks etc). What it\u2019s done is done and from my point of view one should try to adjust to the new reality or choose a different distro.</p>\n<p>On the positive side, Unity always shipped with a very large number of Gnome programs so most of the applications you used are still available by default. Moreover there are lots of interesting Gnome Extensions that can help you configure your desktop to be more unity-like. For instance the <a href=\"https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/307/dash-to-dock/\" target=\"_blank\">Dash to Dock</a> extension will allow you to customize the Dash (location, launcher button, styles etc) and offers significantly more options than the default forked extension offered by Ubuntu. For those of you who are fond of the Indicator Applets, Canonical <a href=\"https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/615/appindicator-support/\" target=\"_blank\">forked</a> the <a href=\"https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1031/topicons/\" target=\"_blank\">Top Icons Plus</a> extension (which is now <a href=\"http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2017/09/top-icons-plus-development-paused\" target=\"_blank\">discontinued</a>). For me the official Indicator extension was enough and covered most of the functionalities that I want but your mileage may vary. Another useful extension is the <a href=\"https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1198/start-overlay-in-application-view/\" target=\"_blank\">Stay Overlay in Application View</a> which is a not very intuitive way of saying that you will get the Application View (Gnome\u2019s equivalent of Unity Dash) if you press the Windows/Super button. These 3 plugins were enough for me to reproduce the bare minimum of Unity and make Gnome more user-friendly. For those of you who liked the Global Application Menu/HUD you can use an <a href=\"https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1250/gnome-global-application-menu/\" target=\"_blank\">unofficial plugin</a>; I personally have not tested it.</p>\n<h1>2. A very large number of Applications crash on Wayland</h1>\n<p>Wayland is the default session for Ubuntu 17.10 and replaces Xorg (even though Xorg is still available). Unfortunately at the time of writing the article, a serious bug remained unresolved which led to the crashing of several applications. The <a href=\"https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/synaptic/+bug/1712089\" target=\"_blank\">problem</a> seems to affect pkexec\u2019ed, su-to-root and gksu/gksudo applications and according to the bug reports popular programs such as synaptic, backintime, gui-ufw and bleachbit do not work. Several workarounds have been proposed such as running <code>xhost +si:localuser:root</code> and then <code>sudo synaptic</code> or switching to Xorg until this is patched. Not the end of the world but definitely annoying.</p>\n<h1>3. Some programs behave differently</h1>\n<p>Even though Unity packed a large number of Gnome applications, most of them were seriously modified. As a result on Ubuntu 17.10 you should expect to find some noticeable differences. For example the Archive Manager does not support exports by drag and drop (maybe it\u2019s a bug?), the save dialog of gedit changed, Nautilus\u2019 navigation and right click menus are different etc. Finally some programs such as the system-config-lvm are not yet available on the latest version.</p>\n<h1>4. S3 Backups hidden on Deja Dup</h1>\n<p><img src=\"http://blog.datumbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/deja-dup-s3-770x367.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-851\" srcset=\"http://blog.datumbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/deja-dup-s3-770x367.png 770w, http://blog.datumbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/deja-dup-s3-300x143.png 300w, http://blog.datumbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/deja-dup-s3-768x366.png 768w, http://blog.datumbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/deja-dup-s3.png 924w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\"/><br/>\nThe default Backup application of Unity had a very cool feature. By installing a simple plugin, one could take <a href=\"http://mooooo.ooo/deja-dup-s3-backups/\" target=\"_blank\">automated backups on Amazon S3</a>. Deja Dup supports also encryption so this yielded a cost effective and secure solution. Unfortunately the developers of the application decided to <a href=\"https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/DejaDup/Clouds\" target=\"_blank\">Deprecate several storage services</a>, among them Amazon S3. They provide a series of reasons of why they did it, but for me this is a very poor choice. One of their core arguments is that Google Drive is more user-friendly than Amazon S3 for the casual users. Fair enough but I thought that Linux was all about the freedom of customization and choice. Moreover Linux typically attracts a large number of power-users comparing to other conventional operating systems. Removing Amazon S3, a solid cloud storage option, makes Ubuntu poorer not richer in terms of options and usefulness.</p>\n<p>Thankfully for now the plugins are still supported but they are hidden. So if you have setup the required libraries (check the first linked article) and run the following command on terminal <code>gsettings set org.gnome.DejaDup backend 's3'</code> you should still be able to take backups on S3.</p>\n<h1>5. How to disable Keyboard\u2019s Sleep/Hibernate shortcut</h1>\n<p>My laptop manufacturer mapped special operations such as Increasing/decreasing the lighting of the screen and the sound volume on the F1-12 buttons. Thankfully to activate them you need to press them along with the \u201cFn\u201d button. So far so good. Unfortunately, they also had the amazing idea of placing the sleep button next to the sound volume button, which leads to accidents and drives me crazy. On Unity it was relatively straight forward to disable it, either via gui (dconf editor) or via the console using the following commands:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: bash; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">&#13;\ngsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power button-suspend 'nothing'&#13;\ngsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power button-sleep 'nothing'&#13;\ngsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power button-hibernate 'nothing'&#13;\n</pre>\n<p>Unfortunately on Gnome these commands don\u2019t work for my laptop. Thankfully it\u2019s Linux, you can customize everything! So after searching for an hour and reading random forum messages and blogposts, I found the following working solution:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: bash; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">&#13;\nxmodmap -e 'keycode 213 = NoSymbol' #XF86Suspend&#13;\nxmodmap -e 'keycode 150 = NoSymbol' #XF86Sleep&#13;\n</pre>\n<h1>Final thoughts</h1>\n<p>Ubuntu 17.10 looks good and with some customization you can make it more usable. There are some gotchas/bugs/problems but hopefully they will all be addressed before the 18.04 LTS. We all need to keep in mind that this is not a LTS version and Canonical tries to iron out the transition from Unity to Gnome. Having said that, it\u2019s a no-brainer that you should not install 17.10 on a production machine. It\u2019s worth trying it out on your secondary PC or on a Virtual Machine; hopefully this will smooth your transition.</p>\n<p>For me testing Ubuntu 17.10 was a good opportunity to move all of my installation scripts from ugly bash scripts to <a href=\"https://www.ansible.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ansible</a>. For those of you who have not used Ansible, it\u2019s an open-source free automation engine which simplifies provisioning, configuration and management of servers. You write scripts in YAML and Python, which beats coding in Bash any day. During the process I ended up writing an <a href=\"https://galaxy.ansible.com/datumbox/jprofiler/\" target=\"_blank\">Ansible role for installing Jprofiler</a> since I could not find any existing solution on Ansible Galaxy. I ended up open-sourcing it so if you use JProfiler in your development give it a try. \ud83d\ude42</p>\n<div class=\"authorsure-author-box\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0d9cf005f5d9fbbe42b6723e723a7f76?s=90&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0d9cf005f5d9fbbe42b6723e723a7f76?s=180&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-90 photo\"/><p>My name is Vasilis Vryniotis.

the client may then use these product photos for the   intended purpose; web or print.&#13;\n  </p><img src=\"/blog/blog_images/1_Bags.jpg\"/><p>&#13;\n  Our   product photography studio is conveniently located in central Toronto   with easy access from all major routes. \u00a0Clients find our location very   convenient to deliver or ship their product(s). \u00a0Our studio works with a   variety of clients ranging from cosmetic companies, e-commerce   retailers, various shops and boutiques, entrepreneurs to independent   artists. \u00a0\u00a0Samples of the many products clients provide us with and want   us to take images of include such items as cosmetics, jewellery,   footwear and clothing, novelty and handmade items, paintings...basically   anything goes whatever shape and up to a certain size. \u00a0Pick-up is also   available for an additional cost. \u00a0In a few instances, when the product   is larger in size or significant weight, such as furniture, gym   equipment, heavy machinery, furniture or items needing assembly we   travel to the clients location with all the necessary equipment to take   the images. \u00a0This type of photo shoot is called \u201con-location\u201d product   photography and additional travel costs are factored into the final   rate.&#13;\n  </p><img src=\"/blog/blog_images/4_LargeEquipment.jpg\"/><p>&#13;\n  Our   team of experienced on-site editors ensure that all work done in the   post-production process is precise and reflects the product most   accurately. \u00a0Our editors are detail-oriented and very careful when doing  any post-production work so that the final image always reflects the   product; close-cropping, colour saturation and fine-tuning, such as   dust, scratch, manikin or other indiscrepancy removal is all done using   Adobe Photoshop. \u00a0By keeping our editors on-site, studioEPIC ensures   that any last minute client request, image alterations and adjustments   can be made right away thus ensuring a quick turnaround time. \u00a0Once   approved, the client receives their final product image(s) in just a few   days of the shoot to use as they wish. \u00a0If requested, as frequently is   the case, we are capable of meeting many clients\u2019 tight deadlines for   images of products which are required asap. \u00a0We always try our best to   deliver the images in a timely manner.&#13;\n  </p><img src=\"/blog/blog_images/7_Cosmetics2.jpg\"/><p>&#13;\n  At   studioEPIC, we have all the necessary equipment in order to take the   best-quality images. \u00a0Our on-site as well as portable equipment includes   strobes (studio lights) with reflective umbrellas, a soft box, a top of   the line product enclosure for even light distribution and, if   necessary, an assortment of backdrops. \u00a0We are also in possession of   variety of professional cameras and an assortment of specialized lenses   to aid us in achieving the images a client desires. \u00a0Having and using   the right lens is especially critical when the fine details of a product   needs to be visible in the final image. \u00a0Each photo shoot has its own   requirements in terms of light and enclosure setup in order to generate   the optimal image quality. \u00a0\u00a0As such, we have a standard set-up fee for   each product lot shipment.&#13;\n  </p><img src=\"/blog/blog_images/3_Clothing.jpg\"/><p>&#13;\n  Our   product enclosure is top of the line and made of seamless moulded   polyurethane, as opposed to \u00a0other product tents, which are cloth and   always full of unwanted wrinkles and grey blotchy areas. \u00a0A good quality   product tent\u2019s main purpose is to make the product(s) look as if   floating; free of horizon lines and uneven surfaces . \u00a0In some   instances, under a client\u2019s request or due to product shape a reflective   shadow is created. \u00a0This does not distract from the final images at all   and in many cases adds dimension and makes the product look natural.   \u00a0However, if this is not the look a client is going for and would rather   have a clean and \u201cflat\u201d look , free of shadows of their product, our   expert team of editors will close-crop around and place the product on a   desired background; clients typically request a pure white background.&#13;\n  </p><img src=\"/blog/blog_images/5_Stylized.jpg\"/><p>&#13;\n  Lastly,   the most important factor and piece of equipment necessary in achieving   the best possible product image are the lights or studio strobes. \u00a0High   quality strobes, along with accessories such as studio umbrellas and   most especially flat white surfaces are a crucial factor to getting a   clear, crisp and well lit product image. \u00a0\u00a0Before each product shoot and   after the product enclosure/lighting set-up is complete we re-calibrate   the cameras to ensure there is no colour cast in the final images. \u00a0Furthermore,   to maintain the correct colour throughout the product photography   workflow, our photo editing monitors are calibrated using a dedicated   hardware calibration device. \u00a0This colour corrected workflow from   strobes, through camera calibration and ending with monitor hardware   calibration ensures that the colour, texture and pattern of the product   on the image reflects the original product. \u00a0This is mainly important in   the case of cosmetics, jewellery, clothing, furniture and artwork.&#13;\n  </p><img src=\"/blog/blog_images/10_Furniture.jpg\"/><p>&#13;\n  For larger products, such as ones that do not fit into the product enclosure and have large dimensions we use one of our backdrops, usually white, black or grey. \u00a0Examples of such products are large machines, exercise equipment or products displayed on models/manikins (such as jewellery, accessories and clothing).&#13;\n  </p><img src=\"/blog/blog_images/9_Art.jpg\"/><p>&#13;\n  As mentioned previously, we have a variety of tools to help us display your product accordingly (whether for print or e-commerce), such as props, manikins, and body moulds, as well as an assortment of styling aids and accessories. \u00a0These tools may be used   for such products as clothing, jewellery, accessories etc.. \u00a0Also, live   models may be arranged at an additional cost for clients requiring this   type of product image.Cosmetic   companies for instance have frequently requested and selected to use   live models to demonstrate their product more accurately, whether to   demonstrate the colour of an eyeshadow shade or the texture of a cream.   \u00a0For these companies, using live models was a better alternative for their products\u2019 final images.&#13;\n  </p><img src=\"/blog/blog_images/8_Shadows.jpg\"/><p>&#13;\n  We   have a variety of custom smudges and smears that we use with the many   cosmetic companies we work with. \u00a0These can be superimposed beside, on   the background or atop of cosmetics to display the true colour of the   product more accurately. \u00a0If you are a cosmetics distributor, your   selected smear/smudge may be manipulated in any way in post-production   to create a custom, one-of-a-kind image, which would not resemble   another cosmetic companies selected image.&#13;\n  </p><img src=\"/blog/blog_images/6_Cosmetics.jpg\"/><p>&#13;\n  At Toronto-based studioEPIC photography, we are proud of the final product images we deliver to   our clients. \u00a0\u00a0Thus, whether your product is large or small or whatever   shape consider using our studio for your product photography needs.   \u00a0Our ultimate goal is to become the leader and ultimately first choice   for clients looking for product photography. \u00a0We plan to achieve this   through clear communication, directly following clients\u2019 specifications   and quick delivery of final top quality images. \u00a0The images will be   bright beautiful and will truly reflect the specific product. \u00a0Choose   studioEPIC for Your product photography to get the job done right!&#13;\n  </p><img src=\"/blog/blog_images/2_Jeans.jpg\"/>&#13;\n  <center>Please contact us if you have any questions or to receive an exact quote.

After some bro named Greg from L.A. gave them a 1-star review because the mountain was mean to him, they created a print advertisement starring his review.</p><p name=\"be7f\" id=\"be7f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I love this ad so much, you guys. Like, more than anything I\u2019ve ever done.</p><p name=\"5b32\" id=\"5b32\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">A few rapid-fire fun facts before I get into those helpful reminders I promised: <a href=\"https://www.snowbird.com/\" data-href=\"https://www.snowbird.com/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Snowbird has a lovely website</a>, designed by <a href=\"http://rallyinteractive.com/\" data-href=\"http://rallyinteractive.com/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Rally Interactive</a>. The creative agency who made the 1-star ad is <a href=\"http://www.struck.com/\" data-href=\"http://www.struck.com/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Struck</a>. If you, like me, want to get your hands on a hard copy of this ad, it will be featured in <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Ski Utah</em>, <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Powder</em>, <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Ski</em>, <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Freeskier </em>and <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Transworld Snowboarding</em>. All of which are somehow completely different publications.</p><p name=\"eb44\" id=\"eb44\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I am not affiliated with Snowbird, Struck, Rally or Greg in any way. I\u2019m just a copywriter from Illinois who knows greatness when I see it.</p><p name=\"5929\" id=\"5929\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">So! Here are your helpful reminders, my friend.</p><h4 name=\"27bc\" id=\"27bc\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">Helpful reminder #1: Cut the\u00a0clutter.</h4><p name=\"e50c\" id=\"e50c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Look at how simple the design is in that ad. A gorgeous photo is allowed to be the star of the show while the URL, phone number and logo are buried in the footer. Greg\u2019s review is the ONLY piece of copy in the entire thing. It\u2019s incredibly ballsy and brilliant.</p><p name=\"b66c\" id=\"b66c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">If you have a bold idea like this one, you might be tempted to add some body copy. Maybe a few bullet points. You know, just a quick list of the key benefits.</p><p name=\"28ed\" id=\"28ed\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Stop. Hey. HEY. STOP TYPING. Keep it simple.</p><h4 name=\"632a\" id=\"632a\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h4-strong\">Helpful reminder #2: Embrace the negative.</strong></h4><p name=\"29cd\" id=\"29cd\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Snowbird knows they have a tough mountain. It\u2019s kind of their thing. The weakness Greg documented in his review is actually one of the main positives of the entire resort, so they decided to have some fun with it.</p><p name=\"00e8\" id=\"00e8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">And speaking of negatives, let\u2019s talk self-deprecation for a second. It\u2019s so hard to do well. Too much or too little of it is a massive turnoff. Somehow, this ad manages to be self-deprecating, humble and thoroughly confident all at once. It\u2019s a remarkable balancing act. Ads like this don\u2019t happen often, but when they do, they spark the same reaction in all of us: \u201cI have to find out more about these guys.\u201d</p><h4 name=\"e75b\" id=\"e75b\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h4-strong\">Helpful reminder #3: Cherish your adventurous clients.</strong></h4><p name=\"9562\" id=\"9562\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Do you know how many marketing directors either A) kill your 1-star testimonial idea instantly, or B) drown it with hundreds of additional words? Because the answer is all of them. They all do it.</p><p name=\"0c24\" id=\"0c24\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">If you\u2019re a creative who\u2019s actually worth your paycheck, you have 1-star ideas all the time. Problem is, they\u2019re often murdered by a committee who eventually just shouts \u201cHEY MORON PLEASE BUY THIS AND BY THE WAY HAVE WE TOLD YOU HOW MUCH WE CARE ABOUT YOU\u201d to their audience.</p><p name=\"c018\" id=\"c018\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Snowbird knows their voice, they know their market and they knew an ad like this would resonate. So they ran with it.</p><p name=\"6410\" id=\"6410\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">If you have a client like this, one who loves your daring concepts and isn\u2019t afraid to do something different, don\u2019t ever let go of them.

Typically, a program family comprises program versions that evolved from a single original program as new requirements have been implemented to it over time. Each program version addresses a specific customer segment or platform. Such program versions have much in common, but differ in some user requirements or design/implementation details.</p>\n\t  <p>ART provides an end-to- end solution for managing program families that eliminates the need for other mechanisms that are often used for that purpose such as macros or design patterns, and significantly reduces the scope in which we apply configuration management systems.</p>\n    <p>ART templates contain code that is common for all program versions in a family - in parameterized form, for ease of adaptation. ART Processor derives program versions from ART templates, based on specifications of requirements that are specific to a given program version (i.e., requirements that have not been implemented as a common part in ART templates).</p>\n\t  <p>ART can be pictured as an advanced form of macros that evolved into well throughout program instrumentation notation, avoiding well-known pitfalls of macros, and greatly extending their power to tackle problems of program versioning. For example, ART gives a programmer full control over propagation of <span class=\"art-command-span\">#define</span> parameters to included files (<span class=\"art-command-span\">#include</span>) to enhance their reusability. Any similar files (or other program structures) can be represented as generic ART templates from which ART Processor generates concrete program files.</p>\n\t  <p>ART can be also pictured as an advanced template system, where any program structure (not only classes or functions) may become a parameterized template, and where parameters may be just anything we wish \u2013 types, program fragments, files or program structures of any kind and size.</p>\n\t  <p>In SPL (Software Product Line) reuse, ART plays a role of <span class=\"bs-ref-info\">Variability Management Technique (VMT)</span> that handles adaptive changes at the architecture to code. In practical SPL reuse scenarios, we typically use a range of VMTs such as macros, scripts, build tools (Ant or make), design patterns, or commenting out variant/optional code for manual inclusion/exclusion. As ART does what the other VMTs collectively can do, there is no need to use multiple (sometimes incompatible) VMTs.</p>\n      <div class=\"bs-callout bs-callout-info\">\n        <h4>Variability  Management  Techniques  (VMT)</h4>\n        <p>\n        help  developers  manage the  base  code  for  families  of  system variants,  e.g.,  a  family  of  Linux  versions  running  on  various  platforms,  or  financial  systems  used  in  different companies.  VMTs  organize  and/or  instrument  the  base  code  for  ease  of  adaptation  and  reuse.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n\t  <p>ART and its predecessor XVCL have been applied in industrial projects as a variability technique to manage reuse in product lines of web portals, command and control systems, mobile games, information systems, and to eliminate redundancies in software libraries (STL, Buffer).</p>\n \n      <h3>How is ART different from the earlier XVCL?</h3>\n\t  \n\t  <p>ART is an enhanced, lightweight and XML-free version of XVCL. Like XVCL, ART is based on concepts of Bassett\u2019s <span class=\"bs-ref-warning\">Frame Technology<sup>TM</sup></span>.</p>\n      <div class=\"bs-callout bs-callout-warning\">\n        <h4>Frame Technology </h4>\n        <p> is a language-neutral (i.e., processes various languages) system that manufactures custom software from reusable, machine-adaptable building blocks, called frames. FT is used to reduce the time, effort, and errors involved in the design, construction, and evolution of large, complex software systems. \n        </p>\n\t<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_technology_(software_engineering)\"><i class=\"link-i\">More about FT</i></a>\n      </div>\n\t  <p>ART improves the user experience by providing the following improvements to XVCL</p>\n      <p class=\"listing\">Easy to learn and use: XVCL is a dialect of XML and uses XML trees and a parser for processing</p>\n\t  <p>ART parts with XML syntax and processing. You can define your own syntax for ART commands, to suit your programming environment and taste, and to avoid conflicts with the base languages. As default, ART offers a simple cpp-like syntax.</p>\n\t  <p class=\"listing\">Expanding the customization options under #adapt command</p>\n\t  <p>In XVCL, the only command that you can place under adapt is insert. ART allows to use any command under <span class=\"art-command-span\">#adapt</span>. We found using <span class=\"art-command-span\">#set</span>, <span class=\"art-command-span\">#while</span> and <span class=\"art-command-span\">#select</span> commands under <span class=\"art-command-span\">#adapt</span> to be particularly very useful.</p>\n\t  <p class=\"listing\">Robust structure instead of unreadable loops</p>\n\t  <p>In XVCL, while loops using many multi-value variables can be quite confusing. ART introduces a structure called set-loop which gives the possibility to store and use more multi-value variables together as one loop descriptor data structure.</p>\n\t  <p class=\"listing\">More flexible</p>\n\t  <p>ART is more flexible than XVCL, as it allows the adaptation of a file even though the file might not contain any ART commands. Such adaptation would simply copy the adapted file to the output stream.</p>\n  </article>\n  <article class=\"post\">\n    <header>\n      <h1> How it Works </h1>\n    </header>\n     <p>\n     Like other pre-processors, ART is a text manipulation system. ART Processor reads ART templates (source code files with embedded ART commands), and outputs source code files ready for compilation. ART commands <span class=\"art-command-span\">(#[cmd])</span> are processed, while code is emitted to the output. The processing sequence is defined by ART commands, which will be explained in this tutorial.\n     </p>\n     <div class=\"bs-callout bs-callout-info\">\n         <h4>Adapting input files</h4>\n         <p> To start processing, we feed to ART Processor the specification file called SPC. ART commands in SPC, and in each subsequently processed file (ART template), are processed in the sequence in which they appear. When ART Processor encounters an\u00a0<span class=\"art-command-span\">#adapt</span> <i>f2</i> command while processing file <i>f1</i>, it suspends processing of file <i>f1</i> and starts processing file <i>f2</i>. Once processing of file <i>f2</i> is completed, ART Processor resumes processing of file <i>f1</i> just after\u00a0<span class=\"art-command-span\">#adapt</span> command. In that way the processing ends when the Processor reaches the end of the SPC.</p>\n     </div>\n     <div class=\"img-crop\">\n        <img src=\"../img/adapt.gif\"/>\n     </div>\n     <p>\n     So far, ART\u2019s <span class=\"art-command-span\">#adapt</span> looks like a cpp\u2019s <span class=\"art-command-span\">#inclide</span>. However, there is an important difference: unlike <span class=\"art-command-span\">#include</span>, <span class=\"art-command-span\">#adapt</span> \u201cA\u201d (as the command name suggests) can modify file \u201cA\u201d at the inclusion point, and it can do so differently at differentinclusion points. Many software components have a potential for reuse, but most often they have to be modified to fit a specific reuse context. ART\u2019s <span class=\"art-command-span\">#adapt</span> together with other commands provide a powerful mechanism to do so. Examples that follow explain how this is done.\n     </p>\n  </article>\n  <article class=\"post\">\n    <header>\n      <h1> Usage and Examples </h1>\n    </header>\n    <p>\n      Let's see how ART can be applied with some simple code snippet examples.\n      The ART language like other languages allows us to declare and use variables. Let's look at the following simple example:\n    </p>\n    <h5>ART snippet:</h5>\n    \n    <h5>Result:</h5>\n    \n    <br/>\n    As we can see, variables can be allocated with the <span class=\"art-command-span\">#set</span> command, and <span class=\"art-ref-span\">?@varname?</span>\u00a0retrieves their value.\n    <p> Values of variables propagate to the <span class=\"art-command-span\">#adapt</span>-ed files. Let\u2019s see an example where  <span class=\"art-command-span\">#adapt</span>\u00a0and\u00a0<span class=\"art-command-span\">#set</span> are used together, allowing for a simple form of adaptive reuse of files:</p>\n    <h5>ART snippet:</h5>\n    \n    <h5>template.art:</h5>\n    \n    <h5>Result:</h5>\n    \n    <br/>\n    <p>A template is reusable program component: First we set up values for variables (template parameters), then we <span class=\"art-command-span\">#adapt</span> a template with our variables to get the result we were expecting. </p>\n    <p>Since the template does not know about our specific settings, we can (re)use it in other contexts, with different values of variables, without any changes done to the template. I can <span class=\"art-command-span\">#adapt</span> a template with my own set of values, and my neighbour can <span class=\"art-command-span\">#adapt</span> it with his own set of values, and we both get the output we wanted, without making any changes to the template.\n    </p><h4>Multi-value variables and loops in ART</h4>\n    <p>We can give multiple values to a variable with a <span class=\"art-command-span\">#set</span> command, by defining the values separated by comma. These variables in ART are called multi-variables or multi-value variables.<br/>ART's <span class=\"art-command-span\">#while</span> command will let us loop over the values of a multi-value variable. Example:</p>\n    <h5>ART snippet:</h5>\n    \n    <h5>template.art:</h5>\n    \n    <h5>Result:</h5>\n    \n    <br/>\n    <p>ART templates not only let us generate source code from reusing templates, but grealy hepl in maintenance and code evolution as well.<br/>Let's say we need to add another class to our example called <i>'Mage'</i>. To do that we only need to make a very small change in our definition and we don't need to change the template code at all. The change is the following:</p>\n    <h5>ART snippet (added Mage class and values):</h5>\n    \n    <h5>template.art (all the same, no change):</h5>\n    <h5>Result:</h5>\n    \n    <br/>\n    <p>This way ART can greatly boost our productivity and we don't need to worry about copy-paste errors or similar inconsistencies caused by user-error.</p>\n    <p>Let's add another small change to our code! Say some warrior classes will have special attack, some will not have, and the ones who have, can have different ones.</p>\n    <p>We need to learn two new commands for this. We will use the <span class=\"art-command-span\">#insert</span> - <span class=\"art-command-span\">#break</span> mechanism</p>\n    <p>Our template will have a <b>breakpoint</b> where we can extend with additional content from our <b>specification</b>, meaning, we can change the template from outside the template without affecting others. Let's see:</p>\n    <h5>the new template.art:</h5>\n    \n  <h5>the new spec file:</h5>\n  \n  <p class=\"bs-callout bs-callout-info\">\n  Later we will show better ways of injecting code, now we used a simple <span class=\"art-command-span\">#if</span> command and matching the class name.\n  </p>\n  <h5>Result:</h5>\n    \n    <br/>\n    <p>Of course, there is much more in ART, however with these essential features and mechanism we can get a great deal of productivity out of it, if used in the correct way. Take a look at the <a href=\"learn\">Learn</a> section to see more examples and explanations of ART commands.</p>\n    <p>Read on if you want to know more about ART in general.</p>\n  </article>\n  <article class=\"post\">\n    <header>\n      <h1>Get ART, Run ART</h1>\n    </header>\n     <p>\n        You can download the ART processor and examples from <a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/projects/vclang\">this link</a>.

With 22,000 people attending the concert that Stephen Paddock opened fire on, the loss and devastation of the hundreds injured and the dozens dead has been felt around the country. One group personally close to home that has been affected is The Walt Disney Company.</p>\n\n<p>Disney\u2019s CEO &amp; Chairman, Bob Iger, summed up the impact in an email he sent to all cast on Monday morning: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In the wake of the tragic events in Las Vegas last night, our hearts go out to everyone impacted by the violence \u2013 the victims, the witnesses, and the friends and families mourning loved ones.</p>\n\n<p>As news of the event continues to unfold, we are devastated to learn that a valued member of our own Disney family, Carrie Barnette, was among those killed in the Las Vegas shooting.  Carrie was part of our culinary team at Disney California Adventure, most recently working at Flo\u2019s V-8 Caf\u00e9 in Cars Land.  She just celebrated her 10th anniversary at Disney earlier this year.  We\u2019re in touch with her family, offering our heartfelt condolences as well as any support they may need in this incredibly difficult time.</p>\n\n<p>Jessica Milam, an attraction hostess at Tomorrowland in Disneyland, was also seriously injured.  She is currently hospitalized, and I ask that you join me in praying for her swift and complete recovery.  </p>\n\n<p>I know we have many more Disney employees impacted by this latest act of senseless violence, who were either onsite or had loved ones who were.  Our hearts are with each of them as they begin to process this terrifying experience.</p>\n\n<p>Bob</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Other emails were sent out to all cast by other high-level Leaders, but Iger\u2019s sums it up in so many words.</p>\n\n<p>Around 70 cast members in total were in Las Vegas, with many being affected \u2013 directly and indirectly \u2013 by the event. Some of them are my personal friends, coworkers, and even my current Leader, Alondra Preciad. Alondra, and others, had been talking about their trips for weeks; some cast were going for the concerts, some for a bachelorette party, and others just to go enjoy their weekend. When news of the shooting broke, my heart followed.</p>\n\n<p>The returned cast that I\u2019ve had a chance to see and speak with have all been in a state of shell shock, understandably. Alondra is still in a state of shock, and she didn\u2019t really have much to talk about for this story as it\u2019s still to hard for her to recount. The day after the attack, she wrote a post on social media summarizing her feelings and has allowed me to republish it here:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To my brothers and sisters who lost their lives during last night\u2019s attack my whole being is in pieces thinking of you - may God hold you in His grace. I will spend the rest of my life thanking God and my loved ones in heaven for protecting myself and Valerie during Sunday\u2019s attack and wondering how we managed to make it out. We ran with all we had and waited out the terror with individuals who became our family in those short hours. We cried and prayed together. I am not one to post on social media but I needed an opportunity to thank the First Responders who ran in as we ran out, Las Vegas PD who did their best to keep us safe and our loving family and friends who provided so many prayers, thoughts, text messages, calls, posts and love. Thank you to everyone, please know that your love can move mountains and I am eternally grateful.</p>\n\n<p>I don\u2019t understand and I don\u2019t think I ever will. I can\u2019t begin to explain how it felt. What we thought were fireworks at first turned into the most horrific moments of my life. When we made it to the roof I thought that we wouldn\u2019t make it back down alive because there was so much screaming from down below. One of the employees that was with us moved us to a crawlspace where we hid for about 2 hrs. We then had to crawl over the ac vents in the crawlspace to go down three flights of stairs to the casino floor. Once out we were told by swat to get out because there was a threat there. We ran outside with our hands up we only got about 20 steps when we heard screaming and were rushed back inside. We were then placed in a ballroom and kept there until 3am. I\u2019m beyond thankful and incredibly emotional, scared. Thank you for reaching out to me and thank you for your love. I know how lucky we both are and I\u2019ll never understand. God bless.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Another Cast Member I spoke with (she preferred not to be named) who left Las Vegas just hours <em>before</em> the event, is in a similar state of shock \u2013 even awe \u2013 because of how close she came to being in the cross-fire. </p>\n\n<p>She spent her bachelorette party at the Mandalay Bay Hotel the night before the attack, staying the same dates as Mr. Paddock. On Sunday afternoon, a bridesmaid of hers \u2013 who was originally intending to attend the concert that evening with her \u2013 was too hungover from the night before, so they decided to head back to Orange County that afternoon. Hours later, when she heard about the shooting, her mind not only feared for those affected but also was stuck by how lucky she got, how close she had come to tragedy.</p>\n\n<p>Her story, and those of other cast members as well, have been an insight to the events on last Sunday for those of us here in Anaheim and around the country. Seeing how that day has impacted them has been eye opening to me, as no major mass shooting has come this close to home. Now that I\u2019ve seen, with my own yeas, the shocked faces; the bruises, cuts, and burns; and the thousand yard stares \u2013 for many days after the event \u2013 I\u2019ll never view these devastating events the same. </p>\n\n<p>I wish the best for all those affected, their families and those close to them.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>On Tuesday evening, Iger <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/business/hollywood/la-fi-ct-bob-iger-disney-vegas-shooting-jemele-hill-20171003-story.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">called out for action</a> against gun violence. From the LA Times article:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"large\">\n<p>Iger said he plans to retire from Disney in 2019. \u201cThis time I mean it,\u201d he said. Many people suspect he might be looking for a post-Disney career in politics.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I would be very happy if Iger made his way into a state or even federal position. Hopefully his tenure at Disney, what\u2019s he\u2019s done for the company overall, and his actions especially in times of crisis like last week shows what he has to offer this country.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n<h3 id=\"disclaimer_3\">\n<a class=\"head_anchor\" href=\"#disclaimer_3\" rel=\"nofollow\">\u00a0</a>Disclaimer:</h3>\n<p>Although I work for The Walt Disney Company, this article is not on behalf of the company.

A country where it\u2019s legal for someone to purchase 30 assault weapons and unlimited ammunition, weapons that really only have one purpose: to hunt and kill other human beings. A country where a cabal of high-powered lobbyists, bought-off politicians, and gun manufacturers profits off of massacres, where the meaning of the Second Amendment has been twisted so intensely that it no longer matters why it was written or what it was actually intended for.</p>\n<p>The leaders of the National Rifle Association, who would be viewed as terrorist enablers and promoters in a sane society, they don\u2019t like the first part of the Second Amendment \u2014 so much so that they don\u2019t include it in their very public memorializing of their Holy Bible of gun addition.</p>\n<p>The version of the Second Amendment displayed at the NRA\u2019s headquarters <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/1994/01/seconds-missing-half/\">doesn\u2019t</a> include the first half of the Second Amendment. The NRA only wants you to focus on the second half, which says, \u201c\u2026 the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\u201d The first part of the Second Amendment, which the NRA finds too inconvenient to include, states, \u201cA well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State \u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Was the Las Vegas shooter a member of a well-regulated militia? No. Were any of the murderers who shot up schools or religious assemblies or workplaces members of a well-regulated militia? No. And regulated \u2014 that\u2019s an interesting word, because no thoughtful person can really argue that guns in the United States are actually regulated in any meaningful way. In this country, you can buy dozens of assault weapons. You can store enough guns and ammunition in your garage to wage a small war. Why? Because the Second Amendment has been laundered through lobbyists, and some Supreme Court justices, to mean something it does not mean.</p>\n<p>The coalition that fans the flames of fear and promotes the idea that guns keep us safe \u2014 that the solution to gun violence is more guns \u2014 makes a shitload of money off of all this death and misery. And they will make more money off of the Las Vegas massacre.</p>\n<p>You can murder 20 innocent children between the ages of 6 and 7 at Sandy Hook Elementary School and these villains are unmoved in their belief in the golden calf of assault rifles. \u201cIf only the teachers had been armed, those kids might be alive today. Now let\u2019s check out our stock prices.\u201d</p>\n<p>Each time we\u2019re faced with a new mass murder with guns, in this case 58 killed and more than 500 wounded, we end up in the same place: \u201cLet\u2019s pray. Let\u2019s tweak this or that law. Let\u2019s talk about using acoustic sensors to detect gunshots. Let\u2019s put armed private security in schools. Let\u2019s use the terrorist watchlist to deny gun purchases. Let\u2019s have more surveillance, more religious and racial profiling.\u201d Which is absurd, given that most mass shooters are white.</p>\n<p>None of what most politicians and TV pundits offer up in the aftermath of these killings is going to do anything to solve the real issue: We are a nation filled to the brim with guns, including assault weapons that are actually meant for assaulting people. Not for hunting. Not for sport, unless your sport is murder.</p>\n<p>Watch what happens in Congress in the coming days. Empty platitudes. Bullshit proposals: \u201cWe must do something about this.\u201d And, of course, a lot of prayer. But none of that is going to change to the fact that we live in a sick society that believes guns bring us security. A nation that has been taught by powerful, twisted people that guns aren\u2019t part of the problem. That everything <em>except</em> guns \u2014 and how easy they are to get \u2014 is the problem. Mental illness is the problem. Muslims are the problem. Gangbangers in Chicago are the problem. Not having a gun is the problem. And when these mass shootings happen, most of the time, the shooter is a white man. We want to know who he was, why did it, what his motive was, as we should. But compare that to how black victims of police killings are treated in the media: \u201cWell, did they do drugs? What were they wearing? Did they have a criminal record? Did they listen to hip hop? Where are the fathers?\u201d</p>\n<p>After he was killed by George Zimmerman, Trayvon Martin was characterized as a thug, his hooded sweatshirt somehow evidence that he was scary or menacing. That\u2019s how black victims are portrayed. After police shot Tamir Rice, the head of Miami\u2019s police union <a href=\"http://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/miami-police-union-president-on-tamir-rice-act-like-a-thug-and-youll-be-treated-like-one-8141523\">called</a> the 12-year-old a thug, saying that if you act like a thug, you\u2019ll get treated like one.</p>\n<p>Contrast that with some of the stories we\u2019ve seen about the Las Vegas shooter \u2014 not victim \u2014 shooter! One <a href=\"http://fair.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/WaPo-Las-Vegas-Headline.png\">headline</a> (since <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/10/02/las-vegas-gunman-liked-to-gamble-listened-to-country-music-lived-quiet-retired-life-before-massacre/\">changed</a>) in the Washington Post said he \u201cenjoyed gambling, country music, lived quiet life before massacre.\u201d Black victim is a thug; white shooter is a character from a country western song who just happens to murder 58 people. It\u2019s sick. And this is a pattern.</p>\n<p>What if mass shootings carried out by white men were covered the same way that stories involving shooters of other races are covered on a daily basis in this country? White-on-white crime. Let\u2019s investigate country music and its violent lyrics. Let\u2019s find some white people brave enough to speak out on this pandemic of white men carrying out mass shootings at an alarming rate. And let\u2019s make them speak for their entire race.</p>\n<p>We all know why the narratives are different. And another thing: We\u2019re hearing once again that this is the most deadly mass shooting in U.S. history. It\u2019s just not true. There are several examples of white gunmen killing huge numbers of black people. The 1917 East St. Louis <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/east-st-louis-race-riot-left-dozens-dead-devastating-community-on-the-rise-180963885/\">massacre</a> resulted in an estimated 100 black people being shot and lynched; in 1873, between 60 and 150 black people were <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/1873-colfax-massacre-crippled-reconstruction-180958746/\">massacred</a> in Colfax, Louisiana. We don\u2019t even know the exact numbers of Native Americans killed in mass shootings since the founding of the United States: Hundreds were killed in places like Sand Creek, Clear Lake, and Wounded Knee.</p>\n<p>Donald Trump, who boasts that he\u2019ll be the best friend the NRA could possibly have in the White House, suddenly found God when he first addressed the Las Vegas shooting. Let\u2019s be real: Trump\u2019s deepest connection to the Bible is watching Charlton Heston as Moses. But religious Trump, who speaks from the Scriptures, was praised for his perfect tone across the media. Specifically, on CNN: \u201cJust what we needed to hear.\u201d</p>\n<p>A big part of our problem on guns is how it\u2019s discussed in the media. Presidents who get prayerful are praised instead of held accountable for the role they play in sustaining this nation\u2019s gun addiction, in promoting the gun industry that profits off of murder. When the shooter is an Arab or a Muslim, they are often immediately branded as a suspected terrorist. After Las Vegas, the president and other politicians called this shooter \u201cderanged\u201d or \u201cinsane\u201d or another word that\u2019s lost all meaning \u2014 \u201cevil.\u201d</p>\n<p>When it\u2019s a Muslim shooter, it\u2019s perfectly acceptable to talk about what the U.S. response should be: watchlisting, banning people from entering the country, surveillance of mosques. But when white people do the killing, don\u2019t talk about guns. That\u2019s politicizing the tragedy,\u00a0disrespecting the victims. Whether it\u2019s someone inspired by ISIS murdering his coworkers or a white man shooting up a school or a white man gunning down Sikhs because he thought they were Muslims, they all do it with guns.</p>\n<p>We don\u2019t need prayers. We don\u2019t need fake unity over the tragedy. We need to look at the common factor in all of these heinous acts of mass murder: guns. Anything else is just putting a Band-Aid on a gaping, infected, and lethal wound on our society.</p>\n<p><em>Adapted from Jeremy Scahill\u2019s commentary on <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/10/04/intercepted-podcast-guns-before-country/\">Intercepted</a>.</em><br/>\n</p></div></div></body></html>"}, "15431069": {"score": 3, "comments": ["Paywalled and the web link doesn&#x27;t work.

This has placed the project in a strong position to go forwards: pre-sale contributions have already met the project\u2019s funding requirements for several years. The main crowd sale launched on Tuesday and any additional funding will permit an accelerated development timeline, along with an increased marketing spend. <br/>&#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\n\t Unfortunately, the beginning of the public crowd sale saw an attack on DOVU\u2019s website. Many crowd sales are affected by high levels of traffic at their launch, as a lot of people try to access the site at the same time, and DOVU was well prepared for this. However, what occurred was a sustained and malicious DDoS attack that meant many users were unable to deposit funds for a period of several hours. Some of these contributors were unable to take advantage of the 10% bonus token period and DOVU took the step of extending the bonus phase for a further 12 hours.

Making a copy of the stack and managing it &quot;manually&quot; probably means a lot of special scanning logic in the GC.", "Could you please explain which stack you are talking about here. If I am not wrong, Java language semantics does not have stack allocated variables, hence my confusion. I sampled the video at random offsets but could not find the location where coroutine implementation was discussed.", "It is the call stack that is being copied. It doesn&#x27;t have to do so much with stack allocated variables (which may be created in Java according to the whim of the compiler) but with capturing the current state of a computation in a relatively light weight manner, so that light weight threads &#x2F; coroutines can be saved and restored without the context switch and memory overhead of a full thread. This is basically the old &quot;green threads&quot; implementation used in the early JVMs.<p>The big idea behind this is the concept of a continuation, and a conversion between programs in &quot;direct style&quot; (the way you normally write them) and &quot;continuation passing style&quot; which makes control flow explicit. You could start reading here if interested: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;matt.might.net&#x2F;articles&#x2F;by-example-continuation-passing-style&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;matt.might.net&#x2F;articles&#x2F;by-example-continuation-passi...</a> Or read about how Scheme compilers work to support first class continuations, and the tricks you can play with them.", "That makes sense. I wasn&#x27;t sure which stack parent was referring to, stack of java activation records, the underlying C call stack of a JVM implemented in C.", "Java has a stack (it uses a stack based bytecode after all) which is used to hold arguments and so forth, and it has local variables whose values live on the stack. What it doesn&#x27;t have is object allocation on the stack - so if a local variable is a reference type then the object it refers to will be created on the heap.<p>Note the above only refers to the logical view of the language. A VM and JIT will have an ABI for method calls which may use registers to pass arguments (it may have several for interpreted and JITed code), and it can allocate objects purely on the stack if it can do good enough escape analysis.", "Either I&#x27;m being very dense, or something doesn&#x27;t quite make sense about these numbers.<p>The slides say that on the busiest day of the year, they were serving around 175,000 transactions per second (126k of which, or maybe additionally, were payments).<p>On the next slide it says they have &#x27;millions of JVMs&#x27; running an &#x27;insurmountable number&#x27; of requests.<p>Is each JVM really taking 10s+ per transaction? Even assuming those JVMs are split between servers, messaging, caching, database, etc, I don&#x27;t get why they need millions of them to handle c. 200k transactions per second.<p>Needless to say, I am not DevOps, so feel free to set me right.", "Each transaction is likely composed of hundreds of requests to various of subsystems, and each of them might have vastly different constraints. I don&#x27;t think the metric of average transactions across all JVMs they are running is a meaningful metric.", "There\u2019s probably a 10:1 or 100:1 page view to transaction ratio, and a 10:1 or 100:1 api request to page view ratio<p>200k transactions is a crazy number - a normal second for amazon is probably a few thousand orders (4-5k).

To achieve this, kernel devs sometimes cannot adopt the most optimized implementation because it may lead to unforeseen corner cases.<p>On the other hand, a company like Alibaba knows <i>exactly</i> what kind of machines and workloads they are dealing with, which means that they can make those optimizations and gain a slight performance boost relative to mainline Linux.", "&gt;Alibaba Runs Millions of Custom JVMs<p>&gt;They have basically forked their entire backend stack, starting from the OS and moving upwards.<p>I doubt this being a cool thing.

Additionally, we provide functions to determine\n  probabilities and quantiles of the conditional response\n  distribution given each of these models.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"#why-use-citools\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\" id=\"user-content-why-use-citools\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"octicon octicon-link\" version=\"1.1\" viewbox=\"0 0 16 16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"/></svg></a>Why use <code>ciTools</code>?</h2>\n<p>Uncertainty intervals (confidence or prediction intervals) for\n  fitted values are easy enough if one is just working with linear\n  models, but when models become more complex, e.g. generalized\n  linear models or linear mixed models, the facilities for\n  quantifying uncertainty for predictions are either more cumbersome\n  to work with or nonexistent. We hope that <code>ciTools</code> provides uniform,\n  model invariant access to these statistics.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"#main-components\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"

The foundations of math are like a constitutional document that spells out the governing rules all mathematicians agree to play by. He has given us a new constitution.\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"240\" data-total-count=\"1809\">Vladimir Voevodsky was born in Moscow on June 4, 1966. His father, Alexander, directed a laboratory in experimental physics at the Russian Academy of Sciences; his mother, Tatyana Voevodskaya, was a chemistry professor at Moscow University.</p><figure id=\"math-promotron\" class=\"interactive interactive-embedded  limit-small layout-sub-medium\">\n    \n    \n    <figcaption class=\"interactive-caption\">\n            <h2 class=\"interactive-headline\">\n            More Reporting on Mathematics        </h2>\n            </figcaption>\n\n        \n    \n    <p class=\"footer\">\n\n        \n        \n        \n    </p>\n</figure>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"299\" data-total-count=\"2108\">Vladimir was kicked out of high school three times, once for disagreeing with his teacher\u2019s assertion that Dostoyevsky, who died in 1881, was pro-Communist. He was also kicked out of Moscow University after failing academically, having stopped attending classes that he considered a waste of time.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"300\" data-total-count=\"2408\">He continued to study mathematics independently, however, and with the mathematician Mikhail Kapranov he published several papers so impressive that he was invited to enroll at Harvard as a graduate student, despite never having applied for admission there and holding no formal undergraduate degree.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"372\" data-total-count=\"2780\" id=\"story-continues-3\">Once enrolled he again failed to attend lectures \u2014 but his body of research was so astonishing, colleagues said, that no one cared. He graduated in 1992 and remained at Harvard to do a fellowship. After spending several years as a member of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, he became a professor there in 2002 and remained there for the rest of his career.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"452\" data-total-count=\"3232\">Dr. Voevodsky was awarded the Fields Medal for his discovery of an elusive mathematical object whose existence had been predicted decades earlier. The object provides a sort of mathematical wormhole that allows powerful theoretical tools in one field of mathematics to be pulled through and used in another. He then used those tools to crack a three-decade-old puzzle, giving birth to an entirely new area of mathematics called motivic homotopy theory.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"225\" data-total-count=\"3457\">Soon afterward, however, he abandoned that branch of mathematics for what was perhaps a more quixotic quest, to find the answer to a fundamental question: How do mathematicians know that something they prove is actually true?</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"184\" data-total-count=\"3641\">This question became urgent for him as mathematicians were discovering \u2014 sometimes decades after publication \u2014 that proof after proof, including one of his own, had critical flaws.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"223\" data-total-count=\"3864\">Mathematical arguments had gotten so complicated, he realized, that other mathematicians rarely checked them in detail. And his stellar reputation only made the problem worse: Everyone assumed that his proofs must be right.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"412\" data-total-count=\"4276\">Dr. Voevodsky realized that human brains could not keep up with the ever-increasing complexity of mathematics. Computers were the only solution. So he embarked on an enormous project to create proof-checking software so powerful and convenient that mathematicians could someday use it as part of their ordinary work and create a <a href=\"https://github.com/UniMath/UniMath\">library</a> of rock-solid mathematical knowledge that anyone in the world could access.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"238\" data-total-count=\"4514\">Computer scientists had worked on the problem for decades, but it was territory only a few mathematicians had ever ventured into. \u201cAmong mathematicians, computer proof verification was almost a forbidden subject,\u201d Dr. Voevodsky <a href=\"https://www.ias.edu/ideas/2014/voevodsky-origins\">wrote</a>.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"391\" data-total-count=\"4905\">The problem was that these systems were extraordinarily cumbersome. Checking a single theorem could require a decade of work, because the computer essentially had to be taught all of the mathematics a proof was built on, in agonizing, inhuman detail. Ordinary mathematicians intent on expanding the borders of the field could not possibly devote that kind of effort to checking their proofs.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"65\" data-total-count=\"4970\" id=\"story-continues-4\">Somehow, computers and humans needed to be taught to think alike.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"361\" data-total-count=\"5331\">Dr. Voevodsky developed a stunningly bold plan for how to do so: He reformulated mathematics from its very foundation, giving it a new \u201cconstitution,\u201d as Dr. Hales put it. Mathematics so reformulated would be far friendlier to computers and allow mathematicians to talk to computers in a language that was much closer to how mathematicians ordinarily think.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"147\" data-total-count=\"5478\">Today, Dr. Voevodsky declared in 2014, \u201ccomputer verification of proofs, and of mathematical reasoning in general, looks completely practical.\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"369\" data-total-count=\"5847\">Further, Dr. Voevodsky integrated the computer into the process of doing his own research, describing it as a bit like a video game. \u201cYou tell the computer, \u2018Try this,\u2019 and it tries it, and it gives you back the result of its actions,\u201d he said in an <a href=\"https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/voevodskye28099s-mathematical-revolution/\">interview</a> with Scientific American in 2013. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s unexpected what comes out of it. It\u2019s fun.\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"351\" data-total-count=\"6198\">Dr. Voevodsky was at the center of an informal but enormous effort to fulfill his vision, having inspired dozens of researchers to join it. \u201cHe\u2019s been our leader, even though he lets everybody do whatever they want,\u201d said Robert Harper of Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. \u201cHe\u2019s this inspirational and spiritual leader by example.\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"201\" data-total-count=\"6399\">Dr. Voevodsky was especially attentive to young mathematicians. \u201cBy being accommodating, encouraging, listening to people, he generated enormous interest,\u201d Dr. Harper said in a telephone interview.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"105\" data-total-count=\"6504\">He also nurtured deep interests in many other fields, including biology, politics and <a href=\"https://vividha.livejournal.com/photo/\">nature photography</a>.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"110\" data-total-count=\"6614\">Besides Dr. Shalaby, he is survived by their two daughters, Diana Yasmine Voevodsky and Natalia Dalia Shalaby.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"227\" data-total-count=\"6841\">Chris Kapulkin, another colleague, at the University of Western Ontario, said of Dr. Voevodsky in an interview, \u201cHis contributions are so fundamental that it\u2019s impossible to imagine how things were thought of before him.\u201d</p><div id=\"addenda\" class=\"addenda\">\n    <div class=\"story-addendum story-content theme-correction\">\n        <strong> Correction: October 9, 2017 </strong> \n        <p>An earlier version of this obituary referred imprecisely to Dr. Voevodsky\u2019s tenure at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J.

They have to do with understanding the human experience at work -- that <a href=\"http://inc.com/marcel-schwantes/11-habits-of-remarkably-likable-bosses.html\">there are certain traits people are innately wired to receive by their leaders</a> in order to feel valued as workers and human beings.</p>\n<p>Richard Branson understands that when his employees' needs are met on a human level, it ultimately impacts his businesses to a greater degree.</p>\n<p>He should know. These are <em>his</em> principles for success, and they've obviously worked for him. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.forbes.com/profile/richard-branson/\">According to <em>Forbes</em></a>, he is now worth over 5 billion US dollars.</p>\n<h2>1. Communicate with your ears.</h2>\n<p>How often we think of communication as \"telling more,\" giving more directions, and sharing more of our point of view when all our most valued employees want is to be heard.</p>\n<p>For Branson, the best of leaders instinctively understand that communication is a two-way street. Here's Branson:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\"Being a good listener is absolutely critical to being a good leader; you have to listen to the people on the front line. That's a very Virgin trait. Listening enables us to learn from each other, from the marketplace, and from the mistake that must be made in order to get anywhere that is original and disruptive.</p>\n<p>An exceptional company is the one that gets all the little details right. And the people out on the front line, they know when things are not going right, and they know when things need to be improved. And if you listen to them, you can soon improve all those niggly things which turn an average company into an exceptional company,\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>2. Accept that failure is the foundation for success.</h2>\n<p>At Virgin, they encourage and even celebrate failure. There's an underlying theme there that, without trying something new and failing, it's virtually impossible to innovate and grow.</p>\n<p>And Branson has certainly failed over the years. Remember <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/oct/06/sir-richard-branson-failures-vigin-cola-brides\">Virgin Cola</a>? Or even Virgin Brides (with Branson <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.virgin.com/richard-branson/fancy-dress-is-not-just-for-halloween\">donning a wedding gown for publicity</a>?) How about <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/richard-branson-fails-virgin-companies-that-went-bust-2012-4#branson-tried-to-take-on-apple--he-lost-11\">Virgin Pulse and Virgin Digital</a> -- which couldn't stand up to Apple's iPod and iTunes? Branson has horrifically failed with the best of them.</p>\n<p>Here's Branson on failing for success:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\"We've never been 100% sure that any of the businesses we've started at Virgin were going to be successful. But over 45 years, we've always stood by our motto: 'Screw it, let's do it.' Do not be embarrassed by your failures, learn from them and start again.

If the person who's working for your company is not given the right tools, is not looked after, is not appreciated, they're not gonna do things with a smile and therefore the customer will be treated in a way where often they won't want to come back for more.

The purpose of reifying a relationship is to make it explicit, when additional information needs to be added to it. Consider the relationship type <i><code>IsMemberOf(member:Person, Committee)</code></i>. An instance of <i><code>IsMemberOf</code></i> is a relationship that represents the fact that a person is a member of a committee. The figure below shows an example population of <i><code>IsMemberOf</code></i> relationship in tabular form. Person <i>P1</i> is a member of committees <i>C1</i> and <i>C2</i>.

Viewing a relationship as an entity, one can say that the entity reifies the relationship. This is called reification of a relationship. Like any other entity, it must be an instance of an entity type. In the present example, the entity type has been named <code>Membership</code>. For each instance of <i><code>IsMemberOf</code></i>, there is one and only one instance of <i><code>Membership</code></i>, and vice versa.

A description of a statement using this vocabulary is called a reification of the statement. The RDF reification vocabulary consists of the type <code>rdf:Statement</code>, and the properties <code>rdf:subject</code>, <code>rdf:predicate</code>, and <code>rdf:object</code>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-rdf_7-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-rdf-7\">[7]</a></sup></p>\n<p>Using the reification vocabulary, a reification of the statement about the person's membership would be given by assigning the statement a URIref such as <code>committee:membership12345</code> so that describing statements can be written as follows:</p>\n<div class=\"mw-highlight mw-content-ltr\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<pre>\n <span class=\"nn\">committee</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"nt\">membership12345Stat</span>   <span class=\"nn\">rdf</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"nt\">type</span>        <span class=\"nn\">rdf</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"nt\">Statement</span> <span class=\"p\">.</span>\n <span class=\"nn\">committee</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"nt\">membership12345Stat</span>   <span class=\"nn\">rdf</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"nt\">subject</span>     <span class=\"nn\">person</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"nt\">p1</span> <span class=\"p\">.</span>\n <span class=\"nn\">committee</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"nt\">membership12345Stat</span>   <span class=\"nn\">rdf</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"nt\">predicate</span>   <span class=\"nn\">committee</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"nt\">isMemberOf</span> <span class=\"p\">.</span> \n <span class=\"nn\">committee</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"nt\">membership12345Stat</span>   <span class=\"nn\">rdf</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"nt\">object</span>      <span class=\"nn\">committee</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"nt\">c1</span> <span class=\"p\">.</span>\n</pre></div>\n<p>These statements say that the resource identified by the <code>URIref committee:membership12345Stat</code> is an RDF statement, that the subject of the statement refers to the resource identified by <code>person:p1</code>, the predicate of the statement refers to the resource identified by <code>committee:isMemberOf</code>, and the object of the statement refers to the resource <code>committee:c1</code>. Assuming that the original statement is actually identified by <code>committee:membership12345</code>, it should be clear by comparing the original statement with the reification that the reification actually does describe it. The conventional use of the RDF reification vocabulary always involves describing a statement using four statements in this pattern. Therefore, they are sometimes referred to as the \"reification quad\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-rdf_7-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-rdf-7\">[7]</a></sup></p>\n<p>Using reification according to this convention, we could record the fact that <code>person:p3</code> added the statement to the database by</p>\n<div class=\"mw-highlight mw-content-ltr\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<pre>\n  <span class=\"nn\">person</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"nt\">p3</span>    <span class=\"nn\">committee</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"nt\">addedToDatabase</span>    <span class=\"nn\">committee</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"nt\">membership12345Stat</span> <span class=\"p\">.</span>\n</pre></div>\n<p>It is important to note that in the conventional use of reification, the subject of the reification triples is assumed to identify a particular instance of a triple in a particular RDF document, rather than some arbitrary triple having the same subject, predicate, and object. This particular convention is used because reification is intended for expressing properties such as dates of composition and source information, as in the examples given already, and these properties need to be applied to specific instances of triples. Note that the described triple <code>(subject predicate object)</code> itself is not implied by such a reification quad (and it is not necessary that it actually exists in the database). This allows also to use this mechanism to express which triples do <i>not</i> hold.</p>\n<p>The power of the reification vocabulary in RDF is restricted by the lack of a built-in means for assigning URIrefs to statements, so in order to express \"provenance\" information of this kind in RDF, one has to use some mechanism (outside of RDF) to assign URIs to individual RDF statements, then make further statements about those individual statements, using their URIs to identify them.<sup id=\"cite_ref-rdf_7-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-rdf-7\">[7]</a></sup></p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Reification_in_Topic_Maps\">Reification in Topic Maps</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Reification_(computer_science)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Reification in Topic Maps\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In an <a href=\"/wiki/Topic_Maps\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Topic Maps\">XML Topic Map</a> (XTM), only a topic can have a name or play a role in an association.

These relations are called <a href=\"/wiki/N-ary_relations\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"N-ary relations\">n-ary relations</a>. Examples are representing relations among multiple individuals, such as a committee, a person who is a committee member and another person who has nominated the first person to become the committee member, or a buyer, a seller, and an object that was bought when describing a purchase of a book.</p>\n<p>A more general approach to reification is to create an explicit new class and n new properties to represent an n-ary relation, making an instance of the relation linking the n individuals an instance of this class. This approach can also be used to represent provenance information and other properties for an individual relation instance.<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">[9]</a></sup></p>\n<div class=\"mw-highlight mw-content-ltr\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<pre>\n<span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nn\">:</span><span class=\"nt\">p1</span>\n<span class=\"w\">      </span><span class=\"kt\">a</span><span class=\"w\">       </span><span class=\"nn\">:</span><span class=\"nt\">Person</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"w\">      </span><span class=\"nn\">:</span><span class=\"nt\">has_membership</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"err\">_</span><span class=\"nn\">:</span><span class=\"nt\">membership_12345</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">.</span>\n<span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"err\">_</span><span class=\"nn\">:</span><span class=\"nt\">membership_12345</span>\n<span class=\"w\">      </span><span class=\"kt\">a</span><span class=\"w\">       </span><span class=\"nn\">:</span><span class=\"nt\">Membership</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"w\">      </span><span class=\"nn\">:</span><span class=\"nt\">committee</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nn\">:</span><span class=\"nt\">c1</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"w\">      </span><span class=\"nn\">:</span><span class=\"nt\">nominated_by</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nn\">:</span><span class=\"nt\">p2</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">.</span>\n</pre></div>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Reification_vs._quotation\">Reification vs. quotation</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Reification_(computer_science)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: Reification vs. quotation\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>It is also important to note that the reification described here is not the same as \"quotation\" found in other languages.

The books are meant to present the minimum amount you need to know in order to digest and learn in the shortest possible amount of time. I published the first book in the series when I was 74. It was received spectacularly well. I thought I was writing a physics textbook, but it made the New York Times Bestseller list. It\u2019s gone way beyond my own expectations. I\u2019m still getting emails everyday thanking me for it.

I've identified 3 particular cases I keep seeing in Software Engineering industry - hopefully speaking openly about them (hence realizing them) is the 1st step to prevent their effects.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Just to make sure we're on the same page, here's the definition of Hindsight bias (HB):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Hindsight bias</strong>, also known as the knew-it-all-along effect or creeping determinism, is the inclination, after an event has occurred, to see the event as having been predictable, despite there having been little or no objective basis for predicting it.</p>\n  \n  <p>Wikipedia (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindsight_bias\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindsight_bias</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It's cool to find out that another phenomenon you observe in your life has a scientific name, isn't it? :) Anyway, I'm not going to dive into HB, it's not a goal &amp; there are plenty of articles (&amp; even whole books) on that (written by actual experts on the topic).</p>\n\n<p>I have some specific (to Software Engineering) scenarios that have either direct or indirect connection to HB - hopefully presenting them in this context will help with dispelling some popular myths ... Let's find out.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"scenario1chosenonesus\">Scenario #1: Chosen One(s) &amp; Us</h3>\n\n<p>Someone's reading a series of blog posts or watching a tech conference session.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>\"OMG, this guy is brilliant! He made it appear that easy &amp; obvious, and he did it so fast while I was struggling with a similar problem for three weeks and the final effect ... well, don't even mention the outcome.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I keep hearing/reading such comments every now &amp; then. And each time I see this awe &amp; admiration in (usually) young peoples' eyes. There's nothing wrong (yet) about that, but it is frequently followed by a statement like that:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>\"I wish I knew as much as this guy, I wish there were options here (in my work environment) to learn all that, projects/products developed in such way, ... But no, our daily work is shit, we do shit, our bosses know only the shit way, nothing could be done sadly.</em></p>\n  \n  <p><em>I wish I lived in a shiny, colourful world where unicorns drink rainbow-coloured water, engineers are kings of the world &amp; all the bug-less code is perfectly DDD-ed, BDD-ed, DevOps-ed, CD-ed, SSR-ed, ... And it has no side effects ...\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Mmmkay. <br/>\nSo, basically - <strong>NO</strong>. This is <strong>NOT</strong> how it works.</p>\n\n<p>We all did shit in the past (&amp; may be still doing it). Even people who appear to look super-smart &amp; super-wise (on-stage, in publications, etc.) they are all made with scars, endless scars made by learning the craft the hard way. <mark>Those without scars are most likely bullshitters &amp; imposters</mark>. In this industry theory is 5% (at max) of success, all the rest is practice, ability to execute, assessing outputs &amp; building loop of actionable continuous feedback.</p>\n\n<p>Some went so far in their path that they've forgotten (hereby enters HB) the painful beginnings and present it as they were not there, but believe me - they (even the most successful ones) were (and may occasionally still be) in the same point you may have been (or still be): clueless, struggling with everything, trying to figure out how to delivery better products in the better way while getting better as an engineer.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"scenario2scoffingiseasy\">Scenario #2: Scoffing is easy</h3>\n\n<p>Engineers jump into some pre-made context that was not known to them previously - already existing codebase, working product, crafted blue-print, whatever.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n  <li><em>\"OMG! Have you seen that?! This is not how you do XXX, ffs!\"</em></li>\n  <li><em>\"What. A. Mess. What were there even thinking when they were writing this code?\"</em></li>\n  <li><em>\"Seriously, someone should have forced him to read YYY book, before they let him write any code ...\"</em></li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Don't pretend you were not in a situation like that ;&gt;</p>\n\n<p>But it was <mark>that obvious</mark>, right? Actually, there's a big chance it wasn't - we, engineers, keep forgetting the fact that <strong>it's many times easier to criticise</strong> (&amp; be right in our critic) <strong>than to do something properly in the first place</strong>. Flow of time changes everything - conditions, expectations, requirements, perceived effects of previous decisions: all of these can't be predicted &amp; the decision questioned may have been made in completely different context. Well, TBH it may have in fact been objectively the most proper / safe / reasonable one - this observation is based on my own, practically validated experiences.</p>\n\n<p>But our HB frequently doesn't let notice this simple fact. Because we would know how to do that properly since the beginning, right? We would not make such stupid mistakes, we would use the most proper pattern, we would react properly and in time. Suuuure.</p>\n\n<p>So my advice is - <strong>don't criticise</strong>. Just don't. Instead, focus on building your systems in a way so they are the least fragile &amp; the easiest to modify. And teaching others, how to craft stuff that way.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"scenario3worldisinmyhead\">Scenario #3: World is in my head</h3>\n\n<p>This one is so loosely related to HB that it may even have a separate name (I haven't heard of). Anyway, it occasionally applies to me &amp; I'm struggling to get rid out of it.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>\"Well, yes, this is something I've been working on (&amp; continuously thinking about) for past 6 months ... I could talk about it, I could share it, but ... everyone knows that already, in the end it has appeared to be so obvious, so natural. I don't want to bore people to death with &gt;obviosities&lt;, I'll need to think about something else maybe ...\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This stuff seems so easy right now that everyone else most likely have figured it out by now. I'm not sure why it took me few months, most likely just because I had all these distractions &amp; context switching. And there was already a blog post or two that covered this topic - everyone in the community has probably read through them already. Totally.</p>\n\n<p>Needless to say, reality proves otherwise. The more time you spend on something, the more you think about it, the more you tinker / try / toy with it, the more you get convinced that <strong>this knowledge &amp; experience you've got is a common one</strong>. You're already behind the learning curve hump, so you've forgotten the effort and the challenge. You actually may even feel embarrassed that it took you so much time, so maybe it's better to avoid getting too public with that, just to avoid the shame.</p>\n\n<p>And then you (by accident, chance, on a whim) share this stuff &amp; find everyone observing you in silence, with a full attention, some maybe even truly mind-blown. Or in some cases (in a less satisfactory scenario) they observe you stunned because they have no clue what the hell you're speaking about - the baseline level of abstraction you've started with is already higher than the top level of their considerations on the topic.</p>\n\n<p>Too obvious, huh?</p>\n\t\t</section>\n\t\t</div></body></html>"}, "15431111": {"score": 6, "comments": ["I never understood Lustig on sugar.

GitHub issue 1048.\n\n* Support REP escape sequence (\\033[b).\n\n* Run alert hooks based on options rather than always, and allow further bells\n  even if there is an existing bell.\n\n* Add -d flag to display-panes to override display-panes-time.\n\n* Add selection_present format when in copy mode (allows key bindings that do\n  something different if there is a selection).\n\n* Add pane_at_left, pane_at_right, pane_at_top and pane_at_bottom formats.\n\n* Make bell, activity and silence alerting more consistent by: removing the\n  bell-on-alert option; adding activity-action and silence-action options with\n  the same possible values as the existing bell-action; adding a \"both\" value\n  for the visual-bell, visual-activity and visual-silence options to trigger\n  both a bell and a message.\n\n* Add a pane_pipe format to show if pipe-pane is active.\n\n* Block signals between forking and resetting signal handlers so that the\n  libevent signal handler doesn't get called in the child and incorrectly write\n  into the signal pipe that it still shares with the parent. GitHub issue 1001.\n\n* Allow punctuation in pane_current_command.\n\n* Add -c for respawn-pane and respawn-window.\n\n* Wait for any remaining data to flush when a pane is closed while pipe-pane is\n  in use.\n\n* Fix working out current client with no target. GitHub issue 995.\n\n* Try to fallback to C.UTF-8 as well as en_US.UTF-8 when looking for a UTF-8\n  locale.\n\n* Add user-keys option for user-defined key escape sequences (mapped to User0\n  to User999 keys).\n\n* Add pane-set-clipboard hook.\n\n* FAQ file has moved out of repository to online.\n\n* Fix problem with high CPU usage when a client dies unexpectedly. GitHub issue\n  941.\n\n* Do a dance on OS X 10.10 and above to return tmux to the user namespace,\n  allowing access to the clipboard.\n\n* Do not allow escape sequences which expect a specific terminator (APC, DSC,\n  OSC) to wait for forever - use a small timeout. This reduces the chance of\n  the pane locking up completely when sent garbage (cat /dev/random or\n  similar).\n\n* Support SIGUSR2 to toggle logging on a running server, also generate the\n  \"out\" log file with -vv not -vvvv.\n\n* Make set-clipboard a three state option: on (tmux both sends to outside\n  terminal and accepts from applications inside); external (tmux sends outside\n  but does not accept inside); and off.\n\n* Fix OSC 4 palette setting for bright foreground colours. GitHub issue 954.\n\n* Use setrgbf and setrgbb terminfo(5) capabilities to set RGB colours, if they\n  are available. (Tc is still supported as well.)\n\n* Fix redrawing panes when they are resized several times but end up with the\n  size unchanged (for example, splitw/resizep -Z/breakp).\n\n* Major rewrite of choose mode. Now includes preview, sorting, searching and\n  tagging; commands that can be executed directly from the mode (for example,\n  to delete one or more buffers); and filtering in tree mode.\n\n* choose-window and choose-session are now aliases of choose-tree (in the\n  command-alias option).\n\n* Support OSC 10 and OSC 11 to set foreground and background colours.\n\n* Check the U8 capability to determine whether to use UTF-8 line drawing\n  characters for ACS.\n\n* Some missing notifications for layout changes.\n\n* Control mode clients now do not affect session sizes until they issue\n  refresh-client -C. new-session -x and -y works with control clients even if\n  the session is not detached.\n\n* All new sessions that are unattached (whether with -d or started with no\n  terminal) are now created with size 80 x 24. Whether the status line is on or\n  off does not affect the size of new sessions until they are attached.\n\n* Expand formats in option names and add -F flag to expand them in option values.\n\n* Remember the search string for a pane even if copy mode is exited and entered\n  again.\n\n* Some further BCE fixes (scroll up, reverse index).\n\n* Improvements to how terminals are cleared (entirely or partially).\n\nCHANGES FROM 2.4 TO 2.5, 09 May 2017\n\n* Reset updated flag when restarting #() command so that new output is properly\n  recognised. GitHub issue 922.\n\n* Fix ECH with a background colour.\n\n* Do not rely on the terminal not moving the cursor after DL or EL.\n\n* Fix send-keys and send-prefix in copy-mode (so C-b C-b works). GitHub issue\n  905.\n\n* Set the current pane for rotate-window so it works in command sequences.\n\n* Add pane_mode format.\n\n* Differentiate M-Up from Escape+Up when possible (that is, in terminals with\n  xterm(1) style function keys). GitHub issue 907.\n\n* Add session_stack and window_stack_index formats.\n\n* Some new control mode notifications and corresponding hooks:\n  pane-mode-changed, window-pane-changed, client-session-changed,\n  session-window-changed.\n\n* Format pane_search_string for last search term while in copy mode (useful\n  with command-prompt -I).\n\n* Fix a problem with high CPU usage and multiple clients with #(). GitHub issue\n  889.\n\n* Fix UTF-8 combining characters in column 0.\n\n* Fix reference counting so that panes are properly destroyed and their\n  processes killed.\n\n* Clamp SU (CSI S) parameter to work around a bug in Konsole.\n\n* Tweak line wrapping in full width panes to play more nicely with terminal\n  copy and paste.\n\n* Fix when we emit SGR 0 in capture-pane -e.\n\n* Do not change TERM until after config file parsing has finished, so that\n  commands run inside the config file can use it to make decisions (typically\n  about default-terminal).\n\n* Make the initial client wait until config file parsing has finished to avoid\n  racing with commands.\n\n* Fix core when if-shell fails.\n\n* Only use ED to clear screen if the pane is at the bottom.\n\n* Fix multibyte UTF-8 output.\n\n* Code improvements around target (-t) resolution.\n\n* Change how the default target (for commands without -t) is managed across\n  command sequences: now it is set up at the start and commands are required\n  to update it if needed. Fixes binding command sequences to mouse keys.\n\n* Make if-shell from the config file work correctly.\n\n* Change to always check the root key table if no binding is found in the\n  current table (prefix table or copy-mode table or whatever). This means that\n  root key bindings will take effect even in copy mode, if not overridden by a\n  copy mode key binding.\n\n* Fix so that the history file works again.\n\n* Run config file without a client rather than using the first client, restores\n  previous behaviour.\n\n* If a #() command doesn't exit, continue to read from it and use its last full\n  line of output.\n\n* Handle slow terminals and fast output better: when the amount of data\n  outstanding gets too large, discard output until it is drained and we are\n  able to do a full redraw. Prevents tmux sitting on a huge buffer that the\n  terminal will take forever to consume.\n\n* Do not redraw a client unless we realistically think it can accept the data -\n  defer redraws until the client has nothing else waiting to write.\n \nCHANGES FROM 2.3 TO 2.4, 20 April 2017\n\nIncompatible Changes\n====================\n\n* Key tables have undergone major changes. Mode key tables are no longer\n  separate from the main key tables. All mode key tables have been removed,\n  together with the -t flag to bind-key and unbind-key.\n\n  The emacs-edit, vi-edit, emacs-choose and vi-choose tables have been replaced\n  by fixed key bindings in the command prompt and choose modes. The mode-keys\n  and status-keys options remain.\n\n  The emacs-copy and vi-copy tables have been replaced by the copy-mode and\n  copy-mode-vi tables. Commands are sent using the -X and -N flags to\n  send-keys. So the following:\n\n    bind -temacs-copy C-Up scroll-up\n    bind -temacs-copy -R5 WheelUpPane scroll-up\n\n  Becomes:\n\n    bind -Tcopy-mode C-Up send -X scroll-up\n    bind -Tcopy-mode WheelUpPane send -N5 -X scroll-up\n\n  These changes allows the full command parser (including command sequences) and\n  command set to be used - for example, the normal command prompt with editing\n  and history is now used for searching, jumping, and so on instead of a custom\n  one. The default C-r binding is now:\n\n    bind -Tcopy-mode C-r command-prompt -i -p'search up' \"send -X search-backward-incremental '%%'\"\n\n  There are also some new commmands available with send -X, such as\n  copy-pipe-and-cancel.\n* set-remain-on-exit has gone -- can be achieved with hooks instead.\n* Hooks: before hooks have been removed and only a selection of commands now\n  have after hooks (they are no longer automatic). Additional hooks have been\n  added.\n* The xterm-keys option now defaults to on.\n\nNormal Changes\n==============\n\n* Support for mouse double and triple clicks.\n* BCE (Background Colour Erase) is now supported.\n* All occurrences of a search string in copy mode are now highlighted;\n  additionally, the number of search results is displayed. The highlighting\n  updates interactively with the default emacs key bindings (incremental\n  search).\n* source-file now understands glob patterns.\n* Formats now have simple comparisons:\n\n    #{==:a,b}\n    #{!=:a,b}\n\n* There are the following new formats:\n\n  - #{version} -- the tmux server version;\n  - #{client_termtype} -- the terminal type of the client;\n  - #{client_name} -- the name of a client;\n  - #{client_written} -- the number of bytes written to the client.\n\n* The configuration file now accepts %if/%endif conditional blocks which are\n  processed when it is parsed; the argument is a format string (useful with the\n  new format comparison options).\n* detach-client now has -E to execute a command replacing the client instead of\n  exiting.\n* Add support for custom command aliases, this is an array option which\n  contains items of the form \"alias=command\". This is consulted when an\n  unknown command is parsed.\n* break-pane now has -n to specify the new window name.\n* OSC 52 support has been added for programs inside tmux to set a tmux buffer.\n* The mouse \"all event\" mode (1003) is now supported.\n* Palette setting is now possible (OSC 4 and 104).\n* Strikethrough support (a recent terminfo is required).\n* Grouped sessions can now be named (new -t).\n* terminal-overrides and update-environment are now array options (the previous\n  set -ag syntax should work without change).\n* There have been substantial performance improvements.\n\nCHANGES FROM 2.2 TO 2.3, 29 September 2016\n\nIncompatible Changes\n====================\n\nNone.\n\nNormal Changes\n==============\n\n* New option 'pane-border-status' to add text in the pane borders.\n* Support for hooks on commands: 'after' and 'before' hooks.\n* 'source-file' understands '-q' to suppress errors for nonexistent files.\n* Lots of UTF8 improvements, especially on MacOS.\n* 'window-status-separator' understands #[] expansions.\n* 'split-window' understands '-f' for performing a full-width split.\n* Allow report count to be specified when using 'bind-key -R'.\n* 'set -a' for appending to user options (@foo) is now supported.\n* 'display-panes' can now accept a command to run, rather than always\n  selecting the pane.\n\nCHANGES FROM 2.1 TO 2.2, 10 April 2016\n\nIncompatible Changes\n====================\n\n* The format strings which referenced time have been removed.  Instead:\n\n  #{t:window_activity}\n\ncan be used.\n\n* Support for TMPDIR has been removed.  Use TMUX_TMPDIR instead.\n* UTF8 detection now happens automatically if the client supports it, hence\n  the:\n\n  mouse-utf8\n  utf8\n\n  options has been removed.\n* The:\n\n  mouse_utf8_flag\n\n  format string has been removed.\n* The -I option to show-messages has been removed.  See:\n\n  #{t:start_time}\n\n  format option instead.\n\nNormal Changes\n==============\n\n* Panes are unzoomed with selectp -LRUD\n* New formats added:\n\n  #{scroll_position}\n  #{socket_path}\n  #{=10:...} -- limit to N characters (from the start)\n  #{=-10:...} -- limit to N characters (from the end)\n  #{t:...} -- used to format time-based formats\n  #{b:...} -- used to ascertain basename from string\n  #{d:...} -- used to ascertain dirname from string\n  #{s:...} -- used to perform substitutions on a string\n\n* Job output is run via the format system, so formats work again\n* If display-time is set to 0, then the indicators wait for a key to be\n  pressed.\n* list-keys and list-commands can be run without starting the tmux server.\n* kill-session learns -C to clear all alerts in all windows of the session.\n* Support for hooks (internal for now), but hooks for the following have been\n  implemented:\n\n  alert-bell\n  alert-silence\n  alert-activity\n  client-attached\n  client-detached\n  client-resized\n  pane-died\n  pane-exited\n\n* RGB (24bit) colour support.  The 'Tc' flag must be set in the external TERM\n  entry (using terminal-overrides or a custom terminfo entry).\n\nCHANGES FROM 2.0 TO 2.1, 18 October 2015\n\nIncompatible Changes\n====================\n\n* Mouse-mode has been rewritten.  There's now no longer options for:\n\t- mouse-resize-pane\n\t- mouse-select-pane\n\t- mouse-select-window\n\t- mode-mouse\n\n  Instead there is just one option:  'mouse' which turns on mouse support\n  entirely.\n* 'default-terminal' is now a session option.  Furthermore, if this is set\n  to 'screen-*' then emulate what screen does.  If italics are wanted, this\n  can be set to 'tmux' but this is still new and not necessarily supported\n  on all platforms with older ncurses installs.\n* The c0-* options for rate-limiting have been removed.  Instead, a backoff\n  approach is used.\n\nNormal Changes\n==============\n\n* New formats:\n\t- session_activity\n\t- window_linked\n\t- window_activity_format\n\t- session_alerts\n\t- session_last_attached\n\t- client_pid\n\t- pid\n* 'copy-selection', 'append-selection', 'start-named-buffer' now understand\n  an '-x' flag to prevent it exiting copying mode.\n* 'select-pane' now understands '-P' to set window/pane background colours.\n* 'renumber-windows' now understands windows which are unlinked.\n* 'bind' now understands multiple key tables.  Allows for key-chaining.\n* 'select-layout' understands '-o' to undo the last layout change.\n* The environment is updated when switching sessions as well as attaching.\n* 'select-pane' now understands '-M' for marking a pane.  This marked pane\n  can then be used with commands which understand src-pane specifiers\n  automatically.\n* If a session/window target is prefixed with '=' then only an exact match\n  is considered.\n* 'move-window' understands '-a'.\n* 'update-environment' understands '-E' when attach-session is used on an\n  already attached client.\n* 'show-environment' understands '-s' to output Bourne-compatible commands.\n* New option: 'history-file' to save/restore command prompt history.\n* Copy mode is exited if the history is cleared whilst in copy-mode.\n* 'copy-mode' learned '-e' to exit copy-mode when scrolling to end.\n\nCHANGES FROM 1.9a TO 2.0, 06 March 2015\n\nIncompatible Changes\n====================\n\n* The choose-list command has been removed.\n* 'terminal-overrides' is now a server option, not a session option.\n* 'message-limit' is now a server option, not a session option.\n* 'monitor-content' option has been removed.\n* 'pane_start_path' option has been removed.\n* The \"info\" mechanism which used to (for some commands) provide feedback\n  has been removed, and like other commands, they now produce nothing on\n  success.\n\nNormal Changes\n==============\n\n* tmux can now write an entry to utmp if the library 'utempter' is present\n  at compile time.\n* set-buffer learned append mode (-a), and a corresponding\n  'append-selection' command has been added to copy-mode.\n* choose-mode now has the following commands which can be bound:\n\t- start-of-list\n\t- end-of-list\n\t- top-line\n\t- bottom-line\n\n* choose-buffer now understands UTF-8.\n* Pane navigation has changed:\n\t- The old way of always using the top or left if the choice is ambiguous.\n\t- The new way of remembering the last used pane is annoying if the\n\t  layout is balanced and the leftmost is obvious to the user (because\n\t  clearly if we go right from the top-left in a tiled set of four we want\n\t  to end up in top-right, even if we were last using the bottom-right).\n\n      So instead, use a combination of both: if there is only one possible\n      pane alongside the current pane, move to it, otherwise choose the most\n      recently used of the choice.\n* 'set-buffer' can now be told to give names to buffers.\n* The 'new-session', 'new-window', 'split-window', and 'respawn-pane' commands\n  now understand multiple arguments and handle quoting problems correctly.\n* 'capture-pane' understands '-S-' to mean the start of the pane, and '-E-' to\n  mean the end of the pane.\n* Support for function keys beyond F12 has changed.  The following explains:\n\t- F13-F24 are S-F1 to S-F12\n\t- F25-F36 are C-F1 to C-F12\n\t- F37-F48 are C-S-F1 to C-S-F12\n\t- F49-F60 are M-F1 to M-F12\n\t- F61-F63 are M-S-F1 to M-S-F3\n\n Therefore, F13 becomes a binding of S-F1, etc.\n* Support using pane id as part of session or window specifier (so % means\n  session-of-%1 or window-of-%1) and window id as part of session\n  (so @1 means session-of-@1).\n* 'copy-pipe' command now understands formats via -F\n* 'if-shell'  command now understands formats via -F\n* 'split-window' and 'join-window' understand -b to create the pane to the left\n  or above the target pane.\n\nCHANGES FROM 1.9 TO 1.9a, 22 February 2014\n\nNOTE: This is a bug-fix release to address some important bugs which just\nmissed the 1.9 deadline, but were found afterwards.\n\nNormal Changes\n==============\n\n* Fix crash due to uninitialized lastwp member of layout_cell\n* Fix -fg/-bg/-style with 256 colour terminals.  \n\nCHANGES FROM 1.8 TO 1.9, 20 February 2014\n\nNOTE:  This release has bumped the tmux protocol version.  It is therefore\nadvised that the prior tmux server is restarted when this version of tmux is\ninstalled, to avoid protocol mismatch errors for newer clients trying to\ntalk to an older running tmux server.\n\nIncompatible Changes\n====================\n\n* 88 colour support has been removed.\n* 'default-path' has been removed.  The new-window command accepts '-c' to\n  cater for this.  The previous value of \".\" can be replaced with: 'neww -c\n  $PWD', the previous value of '' which meant current path of the pane can\n  be specified as:  'neww -c \"#{pane_current_path}\"'\n\nDeprecated Changes\n==================\n\n* The single format specifiers:  #A -&gt; #Z (where defined) have been\n  deprecated and replaced with longer-named equivalents, as listed in the\n  FORMATS section of the tmux manpage.\n* The various foo-{fg,bg,attr} commands have been deprecated and replaced\n  with equivalent foo-style option instead.  Currently this is still\n  backwards-compatible, but will be removed over time.\n\nNormal Changes\n==============\n\n* A new environment variable TMUX_TMPDIR is now honoured, allowing the\n  socket directory to be set outside of TMPDIR (/tmp/ if not set).\n* If -s not given to swap-pane the current pane is assumed.\n* A #{pane_synchronized} format specifier has been added to be a conditional\n  format if a pane is in a synchronised mode (c.f. synchronize-panes)\n* Tmux now runs under Cygwin natively.\n* Formats can now be nested within each other and expanded accordingly.\n* Added 'automatic-rename-format' option to allow the automatic rename\n  mechanism to use something other than the default of\n  #{pane_current_command}.\n* new-session learnt '-c' to specify the starting directory for that session\n  and all subsequent windows therein.\n* The session name is now shown in the message printed to the terminal when\n  a session is detached.\n* Lots more format specifiers have been added.\n* Server race conditions have been fixed; in particular commands are not run\n  until after the configuration file is read completely.\n* Case insensitive searching in tmux's copy-mode is now possible.\n* attach-session and switch-client learnt the '-t' option to accept a window\n  and/or a pane to use.\n* Copy-mode is only exited if no selection is in progress.\n* Paste key in copy-mode is now possible to enter text from the clipboard.\n* status-interval set to '0' now works as intended.\n* tmux now supports 256 colours running under fbterm.\n* Many bug fixes!\n\nCHANGES FROM 1.7 TO 1.8, 26 March 2013\n\nIncompatible Changes\n====================\n\n* layout redo/undo has been removed.\n\nNormal Changes\n==============\n\n* Add halfpage up/down bindings to copy mode.\n* Session choosing fixed to work with unattached sessions.\n* New window options window-status-last-{attr,bg,fg} to denote the last\n  window which was active.\n* Scrolling in copy-mode now scrolls the region without moving the mouse\n  cursor.\n* run-shell learnt '-t' to specify the pane to use when displaying output.\n* Support for middle-click pasting.\n* choose-tree learns '-u' to start uncollapsed.\n* select-window learnt '-T' to toggle to the last window if it's already\n  current.\n* New session option 'assume-paste-time' for pasting text versus key-binding\n  actions.\n* choose-* commands now work outside of an attached client.\n* Aliases are now shown for list-commands command.\n* Status learns about formats.\n* Free-form options can be set with set-option if prepended with an '@'\n  sign.\n* capture-pane learnt '-p' to send to stdout, and '-e' for capturing escape\n  sequences, and '-a' to capture the alternate screen, and '-P' to dump\n  pending output.\n* Many new formats added (client_session, client_last_session, etc.)\n* Control mode, which is a way for a client to send tmux commands.\n  Currently more useful to users of iterm2.\n* resize-pane learnt '-x' and '-y' for absolute pane sizing.\n* Config file loading now reports errors from all files which are loaded via\n  the 'source-file' command.\n* 'copy-pipe' mode command to copy selection and pipe the selection to a\n  command.\n* Panes can now emit focus notifications for certain applications\n  which use those.\n* run-shell and if-shell now accept formats.\n* resize-pane learnt '-Z' for zooming a pane temporarily.\n* new-session learnt '-A' to make it behave like attach-session.\n* set-option learnt '-o' to prevent setting an option which is already set.\n* capture-pane and show-options learns '-q' to silence errors.\n* New command 'wait-for' which blocks a client until woken up again.\n* Resizing panes will now reflow the text inside them.\n* Lots and lots of bug fixes, fixing memory-leaks, etc.\n* Various manpage improvements.\n\nCHANGES FROM 1.6 TO 1.7, 13 October 2012\n\n* tmux configuration files now support line-continuation with a \"\\\" at the\n  end of a line.\n* New option status-position to move the status line to the top or bottom of\n  the screen.\n* Enforce history-limit option when clearing the screen.\n* Give each window a unique id, like panes but prefixed with @.\n* Add pane id to each pane in layout description (while still accepting\n  the old form).\n* Provide defined ways to set the various default-path possibilities: ~\n  for home directory, . for server start directory, - for session start\n  directory and empty for the pane's working directory (the default). All\n  can also be used as part of a relative path (eg -/foo). Also provide -c\n  flags to neww and splitw to override default-path setting.\n* Add -l flag to send-keys to send input literally (without translating\n  key names).\n* Allow a single option to be specified to show-options to show just that\n  option.\n* New command \"move-pane\" (like join-pane but allows the same window).\n* join-pane and move-pane commands learn \"-b\" option to place the pane to\n  the left or above.\n* Support for bracketed-paste mode.\n* Allow send-keys command to accept hex values.\n* Add locking around \"start-server\" to avoid race-conditions.\n* break-pane learns -P/-F arguments for display formatting.\n* set-option learns \"-q\" to make it quiet, and not print out anything.\n* copy mode learns \"wrap-search\" option.\n* Add a simple form of output rate limiting by counting the number of\n  certain C0 sequences (linefeeds, backspaces, carriage returns) and if it\n  exceeds a threshold (current default 250/millisecond), start to redraw\n  the pane every 100 milliseconds instead of making each change as it\n  comes. Two configuration options - c0-change-trigger and\n  c0-change-interval.\n* find-window learns new flags:  \"-C\", \"-N\", \"-T\" to match against either or\n  all of a window's content, name, or title.  Defaults to all three options\n  if none specified.\n* find-window automatically selects the appropriate pane for the found\n  matches.\n* show-environment can now accept one option to show that environment value.\n* Exit mouse mode when end-of-screen reached when scrolling with the mouse\n  wheel.\n* select-layout learns -u and -U for layout history stacks.\n* kill-window, detach-client, kill-session all  learn \"-a\" option for\n  killing all but the current thing specified.\n* move-window learns \"-r\" option to renumber window sequentially in a\n  session.\n* New session option \"renumber-windows\" to automatically renumber windows in\n  a session when a window is closed.  (see \"move-window -r\").\n* Only enter copy-mode on scroll up.\n* choose-* and list-* commands all use \"-F\" for format specifiers.\n* When spawning external commands, the value from the \"default-shell\" option\n  is now used, rather than assuming /bin/sh.\n* New choose-tree command to render window/sessions as a tree for selection.\n* display-message learns new format options.\n* For linked-windows across sessions, all flags for that window are now\n  cleared across sessions.\n* Lots and lots of bug fixes, fixing memory-leaks, etc.\n* Various manpage improvements.\n\nCHANGES FROM 1.5 TO 1.6, 23 January 2012\n\n* Extend the mode-mouse option to add a third choice which means the mouse\n  does not enter copy mode.\n* Add a -r flag to switch-client to toggle the client read-only flag.\n* Add pane-base-index option.\n* Support \\ for line continuation in the configuration file.\n* Framework for more powerful formatting of command output and use it for\n  list-{panes,windows,sessions}. This allows more descriptive replacements\n  (such as #{session_name}) and conditionals.\n* Mark dead panes with some text saying they are dead.\n* Reject $SHELL if it is not a full path.\n* Add -S option to refresh-client to redraw status line.\n* Add an else clause for if-shell.\n* Try to resolve relative paths for loadb and saveb (first, using client\n  working directory, if any, then default-path or session working directory).\n* Support for \\e[3J to clear the history and send the corresponding\n  terminfo code (E3) before locking.\n* When in copy mode, make repeat count indicate buffer to replace, if used.\n* Add screen*:XT to terminal-overrides for tmux-in-tmux.\n* Status-line message attributes added.\n* Move word-separators to be a session rather than window option.\n* Change the way the working directory for new processes is discovered. If\n  default-path isn't empty, it is used. Otherwise, if a new window is created\n  from the command-line, the working directory of the client is used. If not,\n  platform specific code is used to retrieve the current working directory\n  of the process in the active pane. If that fails, the directory where the\n  session was created is used, instead.\n* Do not change the current pane if both mouse-select-{pane,window} are\n  enabled.\n* Add \\033[s and \\033[u to save and restore cursor position.\n* Allow $HOME to be used as default-path.\n* Add CNL and CPL escape sequences.\n* Calculate last position correctly for UTF-8 wide characters.\n* Add an option allow-rename to disable the window rename escape sequence.\n* Attributes for each type of status-line alert (ie bell, content and\n  activity) added. Therefore, remove the superfluous options\n  window-status-alert-{attr,bg,fg}.\n* Add a -R flag to send-keys to reset the terminal.\n* Add strings to allow the aixterm bright colours to be used when\n  configuring colours.\n* Drop the ability to have a list of keys in the prefix in favour of two\n  separate options, prefix and prefix2.\n* Flag -2 added to send-prefix to send the secondary prefix key.\n* Show pane size in top right of display panes mode.\n* Some memory leaks plugged.\n* More command-prompt editing improvements.\n* Various manpage improvements.\n* More Vi mode improvements.\n\nCHANGES FROM 1.4 TO 1.5, 09 July 2011\n\n* Support xterm mouse modes 1002 and 1003.\n* Change from a per-session stack of buffers to one global stack. This renders\n  copy-buffer useless and makes buffer-limit now a server option.\n* Fix most-recently-used choice by avoiding reset the activity timer for\n  unattached sessions every second.\n* Add a -P option to new-window and split-window to print the new window or\n  pane index in target form (useful to pass it into other commands).\n* Handle a # at the end of a replacement string (such as status-left)\n  correctly.\n* Support for UTF-8 mouse input (\\033[1005h) which was added in xterm 262.\n  If the new mouse-utf8 option is on, UTF-8 mouse input is enabled for all\n  UTF-8 terminals. The option defaults to on if LANG etc are set in the same\n  manner as the utf8 option.\n* Support for HP-UX.\n* Accept colours of the hex form #ffffff and translate to the nearest from the\n  xterm(1) 256-colour set.\n* Clear the non-blocking IO flag (O_NONBLOCK) on the stdio file descriptors\n  before closing them (fixes things like \"tmux ls &amp;&amp; cat\").\n* Use TMPDIR if set.\n* Fix next and previous session functions to actually work.\n* Support -x and -y for new-session to specify the initial size of the window\n  if created detached with -d.\n* Make bind-key accept characters with the top-bit-set and print them as octal.\n* Set $TMUX without the session when background jobs are run.\n* Simplify the way jobs work and drop the persist type, so all jobs are\n  fire-and-forget.\n* Accept tcgetattr/tcsetattr(3) failure, fixes problems with fatal() if the\n  terminal disappears while locked.\n* Add a -P option to detach to HUP the client's parent process (usually causing\n  it to exit as well).\n* Support passing through escape sequences to the underlying terminal by using\n  DCS with a \"tmux;\" prefix.\n* Prevent tiled producing a corrupt layout when only one column is needed.\n* Give each pane created in a tmux server a unique id (starting from 0), put it\n  in the TMUX_PANE environment variable and accept it as a target.\n* Allow a start and end line to be specified for capture-pane which may be\n  negative to capture part of the history.\n* Add -a and -s options to lsp to list all panes in the server or session\n  respectively. Likewise add -s to lsw.\n* Change -t on display-message to be target-pane for the #[A-Z] replacements\n  and add -c as target-client.\n* The attach-session command now prefers the most recently used unattached\n  session.\n* Add -s option to detach-client to detach all clients attached to a session.\n* Add -t to list-clients.\n* Change window with mouse wheel over status line if mouse-select-window is on.\n* When mode-mouse is on, automatically enter copy mode when the mouse is\n  dragged or the mouse wheel is used. Also exit copy mode when the mouse wheel\n  is scrolled off the bottom.\n* Provide #h character pair for short hostname (no domain).\n* Don't use strnvis(3) for the title as it breaks UTF-8.\n* Use the tsl and fsl terminfo(5) capabilities to update terminal title and\n  automatically fill them in on terminals with the XT capability (which means\n  their title setting is xterm-compatible).\n* Add a new option, mouse-resize-pane. When on, panes may be resized by\n  dragging their borders.\n* Fix crash by resetting last pane on {break,swap}-pane across windows.\n* Add three new copy-mode commands - select-line, copy-line, copy-end-of-line.\n* Support setting the xterm clipboard when copying from copy mode using the\n  xterm escape sequence for the purpose (if xterm is configured to allow it).\n* Support xterm(1) cursor colour change sequences through terminfo(5) Cc\n  (set) and Cr (reset) extensions.\n* Support DECSCUSR sequence to set the cursor style with two new terminfo(5)\n  extensions, Cs and Csr.\n* Make the command-prompt custom prompts recognize the status-left option\n  character pairs.\n* Add a respawn-pane command.\n* Add a couple of extra xterm-style keys that gnome terminal provides.\n* Allow the initial context on prompts to be set with the new -I option to\n  command-prompt. Include the current window and session name in the prompt\n  when renaming and add a new key binding ($) for rename session.\n* Option bell-on-alert added to trigger the terminal bell when there is an\n  alert.\n* Change the list-keys format so that it shows the keys using actual tmux\n  commands which should be able to be directly copied into the config file.\n* Show full targets for lsp/lsw -a.\n* Make confirm-before prompt customizable with -p option like command-prompt\n  and add the character pairs #W and #P to the default kill-{pane,window}\n  prompts.\n* Avoid sending data to suspended/locked clients.\n* Small memory leaks in error paths plugged.\n* Vi mode improvements.\n\nCHANGES FROM 1.3 TO 1.4, 27 December 2010\n\n* Window bell reporting fixed.\n* Show which pane is active in the list-panes output.\n* Backoff reworked.\n* Prevent the server from dying when switching into copy mode when already\n  in a different mode.\n* Reset running jobs when the status line is enabled or disabled.\n* Simplify xterm modifier detection.\n* Avoid crashing in copy mode if the screen size is too small for the\n  indicator.\n* Flags -n and -p added to switch-client.\n* Use UTF-8 line drawing characters on UTF-8 terminals, thus fixing some\n  terminals (eg putty) which disable the vt100 ACS mode switching sequences\n  in UTF-8 mode. On terminals without ACS, use ASCII equivalents.\n* New server option exit-unattached added.\n* New session option destroy-unattached added.\n* Fall back on normal session choice method if $TMUX exists but is invalid\n  rather than rejecting.\n* Mark repeating keys with \"(repeat)\" in the key list.\n* When removing a pane, don't change the active pane unless the active pane\n  is actually the one being removed.\n* New command last-pane added.\n* AIX fixes.\n* Flag -a added to unbind-key.\n* Add XAUTHORITY to update-environment.\n* More info regarding window and pane flags is now shown in list-*.\n* If VISUAL or EDITOR contains \"vi\" configure mode-keys and status-key to vi.\n* New window option monitor-silence and session option visual-silence added.\n* In the built-in layouts distribute the panes more evenly.\n* Set the default value of main-pane-width to 80 instead of 81.\n* Command-line flag -V added.\n* Instead of keeping a per-client prompt history make it global.\n* Fix rectangle copy to behave like emacs (the cursor is not part of the\n  selection on the right edge but on the left it is).\n* Flag -l added to switch-client.\n* Retrieve environment variables from the global environment rather than\n  getenv(3), thus allowing them to be updated during the configuration file.\n* New window options other-pane-{height,width} added.\n* More minor bugs fixed and manpage improvements.\n\nCHANGES FROM 1.2 TO 1.3, 18 July 2010\n\n* New input parser.\n* Flags to move through panes -UDLR added to select-pane.\n* Commands up-pane, and down-pane removed, since equivalent behaviour is now\n  available through the target flag (-t:+ and -t:-).\n* Jump-forward/backward in copy move (based on vi's F, and f commands).\n* Make paste-buffer accept a pane as a target.\n* Flag -a added to new-window to insert a window after an existing one, moving\n  windows up if necessary.\n* Merge more mode into copy mode.\n* Run job commands explicitly in the global environment (which can be modified\n  with setenv -g), rather than with the environment tmux started with.\n* Use the machine's hostname as the default title, instead of an empty string.\n* Prevent double free if the window option remain-on-exit is set. \n* Key string conversions rewritten.\n* Mark zombie windows as dead in the choose-window list.\n* Tiled layout added.\n* Signal handling reworked.\n* Reset SIGCHLD after fork to fix problems with some shells.\n* Select-prompt command removed. Therefore, bound ' to command-prompt -p index\n  \"select-window -t:%%\" by default.\n* Catch SIGHUP and terminate if running as a client, thus avoiding clients from\n  being left hanging around when, for instance, a SSH session is disconnected.\n* Solaris 9 fixes (such as adding compat {get,set}env(3) code).\n* Accept none instead of default for attributes.\n* Window options window-status-alert-{alert,bg,fg} added.\n* Flag -s added to the paste-buffer command to specify a custom separator.\n* Allow dragging to make a selection in copy mode if the mode-mouse option is\n  set.\n* Support the mouse scroll wheel.\n* Make pipe-pane accept special character sequences (eg #I).\n* Fix problems with window sizing when starting tmux from .xinitrc.\n* Give tmux sockets (but not the containing folder) group permissions.\n* Extend the target flags (ie -t) to accept an offset (for example -t:+2), and\n  make it wrap windows, and panes.\n* New command choose-buffer added.\n* New server option detach-on-destroy to set what happens to a client when the\n  session it is attached to is destroyed. If on (default), the client is\n  detached. Otherwise, the client is switched to the most recently active of\n  the remaining sessions.\n* The commands load-buffer, and save-buffer now accept a dash (-) as the file\n  to read from stdin, or write to stdout.\n* Custom layouts added.\n* Additional code reduction, bug fixes, and manpage enhancements.\n\nCHANGES FROM 1.1 TO 1.2, 10 March 2010\n\n* Switch to libevent.\n* Emulate the ri (reverse index) capability, ergo allowing tmux to at least\n  start on Sun consoles (TERM=sun, or sun-color).\n* Assign each entry a number, or lowercase letter in choose mode, and accept\n  that as a shortcut key.\n* Permit top-bit-set characters to be entered in the status line.\n* Mark no-prefix keys with (no prefix), rather than [] in list-keys.\n* New command show-messages (alias showmsgs), and new session option\n  message-limit, to show a per-client log of status lines messages up to the\n  number defined by message-limit.\n* Do not interpret #() for display-message to avoid leaking commands.\n* New window options window-status-format, and window-status-current-format to\n  control the format of each window in the status line.\n* Add a -p flag to display-message to print the output, instead of displaying\n  it in the status line.\n* Emulate il1, dl1, ich1 to run with vt100 feature set.\n* New command capture-pane (alias capturep) to copy the entire pane contents\n  to a paste buffer.\n* Avoid duplicating code by adding a -w flag to set-option, and show-options to\n  set, and show window options. The commands set-window-option, and\n  show-window-options are now aliases.\n* Panes can now be referred to as top, bottom, top-left, etc.\n* Add server-wide options, which can be set with set-option -s, and shown with\n  show-options -s.\n* New server option quiet (like -q from the command line).\n* New server option escape-time to set the timeout used to detect if escapes\n  are alone, part of a function key, or meta sequence.\n* New session options pane-active-border-bg, pane-active-border-fg,\n  pane-border-bg, and pane-border-fg to set pane colours.\n* Make split-window accept a pane target, instead of a window.\n* New command join-pane (alias joinp) to split, and move an existing pane into\n  the space (the opposite of break-pane), thus simplifying calls to\n  split-window, followed by move-window.\n* Permit S- prefix on keys for shift when the terminal/terminfo supports them.\n* Window targets (-t flag) can now refer to the last window (!), next (+), and\n  previous (-) window by number.\n* Mode keys to jump to the bottom/top of history, end of the next word, scroll\n  up/down, and reverse search in copy mode.\n* New session option display-panes-active-colour to display the active pane in\n  a different colour with the display-panes command.\n* Read the socket path from $TMUX if it's present, and -L, and -S are not\n  given.\n* Vi-style mode keys B, W, and E to navigate between words in copy mode.\n* Start in more mode when configuration file errors are detected.\n* Rectangle copy support added.\n* If attach-session was specified with the -r flag, make the client read-only.\n* Per-window alternate-screen option.\n* Make load-buffer work with FIFOs.\n* New window option word-separators to set the characters considered as word\n  separators in copy mode.\n* Permit keys in copy mode to be prefixed by a repeat count, entered with [1-9]\n  in vi mode, or M-[1-9] in emacs mode.\n* utf8 improvements.\n* As usual, additional code reduction, bug fixes, and manpage enhancements.\n\nCHANGES FROM 1.0 TO 1.1, 05 November 2009\n\n* New run-shell (alias run) command to run an external command without a\n  window, capture it's stdout, and send it to output mode.\n* Ability to define multiple prefix keys.\n* Internal locking mechanism removed. Instead, detach each client and run the\n  external command specified in the new session option lock-command (by default\n  lock -np), thus allowing the system password to be used.\n* set-password command, and -U command line flag removed per the above change.\n* Add support for -c command line flag to execute a shell command.\n* New lock-client (alias lockc), and lock-session (alias locks) commands to\n  lock a particular client, or all clients attached to a session.\n* Support C-n/C-p/C-v/M-v with emacs keys in choice mode.\n* Use : for goto line rather than g in vi mode. \n* Try to guess which client to use when no target client was specified. Finds\n  the current session, and if only one client is present, use it. Otherwise,\n  return the most recently used client.\n* Make C-Down/C-Up in copy mode scroll the screen down/up one line without\n  moving the cursor.\n* Scroll mode superseded by copy mode.\n* New synchronize-panes window option to send all input to all other panes in\n  the same window.\n* New lock-server session option to lock, when off (on by default), each\n  session when it has been idle for the lock-after-time setting. When on, the\n  entire server locks when all sessions have been idle for their individual\n  lock-after-time setting.\n* Add support for grouped sessions which have independent name, options,\n  current window, but where the linked windows are synchronized (ie creating,\n  killing windows are mirrored between the sessions). A grouped session may be\n  created by passing -t to new-session.\n* New mouse-select-pane session option to select the current pane with the\n  mouse.\n* Queue, and run commands in the background for if-shell, status-left,\n  status-right, and #() by starting each once every status-interval. Adds the\n  capability to call some programs which would previously cause the server to\n  hang (eg sleep/tmux). It also avoids running commands excessively (ie if used\n  multiple times, it will be run only once).\n* When a window is zombified and automatic-rename is on, append [dead] to the\n  name.\n* Split list-panes (alias lsp) off from list-windows.\n* New pipe-pane (alias pipep) to redirect a pane output to an external command.\n* Support for automatic-renames for Solaris.\n* Permit attributes to be turned off in #[] by prefixing with no (eg nobright).\n* Add H/M/L in vi mode, and M-R/M-r in emacs to move the cursor to the top,\n  middle, and bottom of the screen.\n* -a option added to kill-pane to kill all except current pane.\n* The -d command line flag is now gone (can be replaced by terminal-overrides).\n  Just use op/AX to detect default colours.\n* input/tty/utf8 improvements.\n* xterm-keys rewrite.\n* Additional code reduction, and bug fixes.\n\nCHANGES FROM 0.9 TO 1.0, 20 September 2009\n\n* Option to alter the format of the window title set by tmux.\n* Backoff for a while after multiple incorrect password attempts.\n* Quick display of pane numbers (C-b q).\n* Better choose-window, choose-session commands and a new choose-client command.\n* Option to request multiple responses when using command-prompt.\n* Improved environment handling.\n* Combine wrapped lines when pasting.\n* Option to override terminal settings (terminal-overrides).\n* Use the full range of ACS characters for drawing pane separator lines.\n* Customisable mode keys.\n* Status line colour options, with embedded colours in status-left/right, and\n  an option to centre the window list.\n* Much improved layouts, including both horizontal and vertical splitting.\n* Optional visual bell, activity and content indications.\n* Set the utf8 and status-utf8 options when the server is started with -u.\n* display-message command to show a message in the status line, by default some\n  information about the current window.\n* Improved current process detection on NetBSD.\n* unlink-window -k is now the same as kill-window.\n* attach-session now works from inside tmux.\n* A system-wide configuration file, /etc/tmux.conf.\n* A number of new commands in copy mode, including searching.\n* Panes are now specified using the target (-t) notation.\n* -t now accepts fnmatch(3) patterns and looks for prefixes.\n* Translate \\r into \\n when pasting.\n* Support for binding commands to keys without the prefix key\n* Support for alternate screen (terminfo smcup/rmcup).\n* Maintain data that goes off screen after reducing the window size, so it can\n  be restored when the size is increased again.\n* New if-shell command to test a shell command before running a tmux command.\n* tmux now works as the shell.\n* Man page reorganisation.\n* Many minor additions, much code tidying and several bug fixes.\n\nCHANGES FROM 0.8 TO 0.9, 01 July 2009\n\n* Major changes to build infrastructure: cleanup of makefiles and addition\n  of a configure script.\n* monitor-content window option to monitor a window for a specific fnmatch(3)\n  pattern. The find-window command also now accepts fnmatch(3) patterns.\n* previous-layout and select-layout commands, and a main-horizontal layout.\n* Recreate the server socket on SIGUSR1.\n* clear-history command.\n* Use ACS line drawing characters for pane separator lines.\n* UTF-8 improvements, and code to detect UTF-8 support by looking at\n  environment variables.\n* The resize-pane-up and resize-pane-down commands are now merged together\n  into a new resize-pane command with -U and -D flags.\n* confirm-before command to request a yes/no answer before executing dangerous\n  commands.\n* Status line bug fixes, support for UTF-8 (status-utf8 option), and a key to\n  paste from the paste buffer.\n* Support for some additional escape sequences and terminal features, including\n  better support for insert mode and tab stops.\n* Improved window resizing behaviour, modelled after xterm.\n* Some code reduction and a number of miscellaneous bug fixes.\n\n================================================================================\n\nOn 01 June 2009, tmux was imported into the OpenBSD base system. From this date\nonward changes are logged as part of the normal CVS commit message to either\nOpenBSD or SourceForge CVS. This file will be updated to contain a summary of\nmajor changes with each release, and to mention important configuration or\ncommand syntax changes during development.\n\nThe list of older changes is below.\n\n================================================================================\n\n21 May 2009\n\n* stat(2) files before trying to load them to avoid problems, for example\n  with \"source-file /dev/zero\".\n\n19 May 2009\n\n* Try to guess if the window is UTF-8 by outputting a three-byte UTF-8 wide\n  character and seeing how much the cursor moves. Currently tries to figure out\n  if this works by some stupid checks on the terminal, these need to be\n  rethought. Also might be better using a width 1 character rather than width 2.\n* If LANG contains \"UTF-8\", assume the terminal supports UTF-8, on the grounds\n  that anyone who configures it probably wants UTF-8. Not certain if this is\n  a perfect idea but let's see if it causes any problems.\n* New window option: monitor-content. Searches for a string in a window and if\n  it matches, highlight the status line.\n\n18 May 2009\n\n* main-horizontal layout and main-pane-height option to match vertical.\n* New window option main-pane-width to set the width of the large left pane with\n  main-vertical (was left-vertical) layout. \n* Lots of layout cleanup. manual layout is now manual-vertical.\n\n16 May 2009\n\n* select-layout command and a few default key bindings (M-0, M-1, M-2, M-9) to\n  select layouts.\n* Recreate server socket on SIGUSR1, per SF feature request 2792533.\n\n14 May 2009\n\n* Keys in status line (p in vi mode, M-y in emacs) to paste the first line\n  of the upper paste buffer. Suggested by Dan Colish.\n* clear-history command to clear a pane's history.\n* Don't force wrapping with \\n when asked, let the cursor code figure it out.\n  Should fix terminals which use this to detect line breaks.\n* Major cleanup and restructuring of build infrastructure. Still separate files\n  for GNU and BSD make, but they are now hugely simplified at the expense of\n  adding a configure script which must be run before make. Now build and\n  install with:\n\n\t$ ./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; sudo make install\n\n04 May 2009\n\n* Use ACS line drawing characters for pane separator lines.\n\n30 April 2009\n\n* Support command sequences without a space before the semicolon, for example\n  \"neww; neww\" now works as well as \"neww ; neww\". \"neww;neww\" is still an\n  error.\n* previous-layout command.\n* Display the layout name in window lists.\n* Merge resize-pane-up and resize-pane-down into resize-pane with -U and -D\n  flags.\n\n29 April 2009\n\n* Get rid of compat/vis.* - only one function was used which is easily\n  replaced,and less compat code == good.\n\n27 April 2009\n\n* Avoid using the prompt history when the server is locked, and prevent any\n  input entered from being added to the client's prompt history.\n* New command, confirm-before (alias confirm), which asks for confirmation\n  before executing a command. Bound \"&amp;\" and \"x\" by default to confirm-before\n  \"kill-window\" and confirm-before \"kill-pane\", respectively.\n\n23 April 2009\n\n* Support NEL, yet another way of making newline. Fixes the output from some\n  Gentoo packaging thing. Reported by someone on SF then logs that allowed a\n  fix sent by tcunha.\n* Use the xenl terminfo flag to detect early-wrap terminals like the FreeBSD\n  console. Many thanks for a very informative email from Christian Weisgerber.\n\n21 April 2009\n\n* tmux 0.8 released.\n\n17 April 2009\n\n* Remove the right number of characters from the buffer when escape then\n  a cursor key (or other key prefixed by \\033) is pressed. Reported by\n  Stuart Henderson.\n\n03 April 2009\n\n* rotate-window command. -U flag (default) for up, -D flag for down.\n\n02 April 2009\n\n* Change scroll/pane redraws to only redraw the single pane affected rather\n  than the entire window.\n* If redrawing the region would mean redrawing &gt; half the pane, just schedule\n  to redraw the entire window. Also add a flag to skip updating the window any\n  further if it is scheduled to be redrawn. This has the effect of batching\n  multiple redraws together.\n\n01 April 2009\n\n* Basic horizontal splitting and layout management. Still some redraw and other\n  issues - particularly, don't mix with manual pane resizing, be careful when\n  viewing from multiple clients and don't expect shell windows to redraw very\n  well after the layout is changed; generally cycling the layout a few times\n  will fix most problems. Getting this in for testing while I think about how\n  to deal with manual mode.\n\n  Split window as normal and cycle the layouts with C-b space. Some of the\n  layouts will work better when swap-pane comes along.\n\n31 March 2009\n\n* AIX port, thanks to cmihai for access to a box. Only tested on 6.1 with xlc\n  10.1 (make sure CC is set). Needs GNU make and probably ncurses (didn't try\n  plain curses). Also won't build with DEBUG, so comment the FDEBUG=1 line in\n  GNUmakefile.\n* Draw a vertical line on the right when the window size is less than the\n  terminal size. This is partly to shake out any horizontal limit bugs on the\n  way to horizontal splitting/pane tiling. Currently a bit slow since it has to\n  do a lot of redrawing but hopefully that will improve as I get some better\n  ideas for how to do it.\n* Fix remaining problems with copy and paste and UTF-8.\n\n28 March 2009\n\n* Better UTF-8 support, including combined characters. Unicode data is now\n  stored as UTF-8 in a separate array, the code does a lookup into this every\n  time it gets to a UTF-8 cell. Zero width characters are just appended onto\n  the UTF-8 data for the previous cell. This also means that almost no bytes\n  extra are wasted non-Unicode data (yay).\n\n  Still some oddities, such as copy mode skips over wide characters in a\n  strange way, and the code could do with some tidying.\n* Key repeating is now a property of the key binding not of the command.\n  Repeat is turned on when the key is bound with the -r flag to bind-key.\n  next/previous-window no longer repeat by default as it turned out to annoy\n  me.\n\n27 March 2009\n\n* Clear using ED when redrawing the screen. I foolishly assumed using spaces\n  would be equivalent and terminals would pick up on this, but apparently not.\n  This fixes copy and paste in xterm/rxvt.\n* Sockets in /tmp are now created in a subdirectory named, tmux-UID, eg\n  tmux-1000. The default socket is thus /tmp/tmux-UID/default. To start a\n  separate server, the new -L command line option should be used: this creates\n  a socket in the same directory with a different name (\"-L main\" will create\n  socket called \"main\"). -S should only be used to place the socket outside\n  /tmp. This makes sockets a little more secure and a bit more convenient to\n  use multiple servers.\n\n21 March 2009\n\n* New session flag \"set-remain-on-exit\" to set remain-on-exit flag for new\n  windows created in that session (like \"remain-by-default\" used to do). Not\n  perfectly happy about this, but until I can think of a good way to introduce\n  it generically (maybe a set of options in the session) this will do. Fixes\n  SF request 2527847.\n\n07 March 2009\n\n* Support for 88 colour terminals.\n* break-pane command to create a new window using an existing pane.\n\n02 March 2009\n\n* Make escape key timer work properly so escape+key can be used without\n  lightning fast key presses.\n\n13 February 2009\n\n* Redo mode keys slightly more cleanly and apply them to command prompt\n  editing. vi or emacs mode is controlled by the session option status-keys.\n\n12 February 2009\n\n* Looking up argv[0] is expensive, so just use p_comm for the window name which\n  is good enough. Also increase name update time to 500 ms.\n\n11 February 2009\n\n* Only use ri when actually at the top of the screen; just move the cursor up\n  otherwise.\n* FreeBSD's console wraps lines at $COLUMNS - 1 rather than $COLUMNS (the\n  cursor can never be beyond $COLUMNS - 1) and does not appear to support\n  changing this behaviour, or any of the obvious possibilities (turning off\n  right margin wrapping, insert mode). This is irritating, most notably because\n  it impossible to write to the very bottom-right of the screen without\n  scrolling. To work around this, if built on FreeBSD and run with a \"cons\"\n  $TERM, the bottom-right cell on the screen is omitted.\n* Emulate scroll regions (slowly) to support the few terminals which don't have\n  it (some of which don't really have any excuse).\n\n10 February 2009\n\n* No longer redraw the status line every status-interval unless it has actually\n  changed.\n\n08 February 2009\n\n* Don't treat empty arguments (\"\") differently when parsing configuration\n  file/command prompt rather than command line.\n* tmux 0.7 released.\n\n03 February 2009\n\n* New command, copy-buffer (alias copyb), to copy a session paste buffer to\n  another session.\n\n01 February 2009\n\n* The character pair #(command) may now contain (escaped) right parenthesis.\n\n30 January 2009\n\n* . now bound to \"command-prompt 'move-window %%'\" by default, from joshe.\n\n29 January 2009\n\n* Window options to set status line fg, bg and attributes for a single\n  window. Options are: window-status-fg, window-status-bg,\n  window-status-attr. Set to \"default\" to use the session status colours.\n\n  This allows quite neat things like:\n\n\t$ cat ~/bin/xssh\n\t#!/bin/sh\n\n\tif [ ! -z \"$TMUX\" ]; then\n\tcase \"$1\" in\n    \tnatalya)\n\t        tmux setw window-status-fg red &gt;/dev/null\n\t\t;;\n\tnatasha)\n        \ttmux setw window-status-fg yellow &gt;/dev/null\n\t\t;;\n\tesac\n\tfi\n\tssh \"$@\"\n\t[ ! -z \"$TMUX\" ] &amp;&amp; tmux setw -u window-status-fg &gt;/dev/null\n\t$ alias ssh=\"~/bin/xssh\"\n\n* Support #(command) in status-left, and status-right, which is displayed as\n  the first line of command's output (e.g. set -g status-right\n  \"#(whoami)@#(hostname -s)\"). Commands with )s aren't supported.\n\n28 January 2009\n\n* Support mouse in copy mode to move cursor. Can't do anything else at the\n  moment until other mouse modes are handled.\n* Better support for at least the most common variant of mouse input: parse it\n  and adjust for different panes. Also support mouse in window/session choice\n  mode.\n\n27 January 2009\n\n* Bring back the fancy window titles with session/window names: it is easy to\n  work around problems with elinks (see FAQ).\n* -u flag to scroll-mode and copy-mode to start scrolled one page\n  up. scroll-mode -u is bound to prefix,page-up (ppage) by default.\n* Allow status, mode and message attributes to be changed by three new options:\n  status-attr, mode-attr, message-attr. A comma-separated list is accepted\n  containing: bright, dim, underscore, blink, reverse, hidden, italics, for\n  example:\n\n\tset -g status-attr bright,blink\n\n  From Josh Elsasser, thanks!\n\n26 January 2009\n\n* Be more clever about picking the right process to create the window name.\n* Don't balls up the terminal on UTF-8 combined characters. Don't support them\n  properly either - they are just discarded for the moment.\n\n25 January 2009\n\n* load-buffer command\n\n23 January 2009\n\n* Use reverse colours rather than swapping fg and bg for message, mode and\n  status line. This makes these usable on black and white terminals.\n* Better error messages when creating a session or window fails.\n* Oops. Return non-zero on error. Reported by Will Maier.\n\n21 January 2009\n\n* Handle SIGTERM (and kill-server which uses it), a bit more neatly - tidy\n  up properly and print a nicer message. Same effect though :-).\n* new-window now supports -k to kill target window if it exists.\n* Bring back split-window -p and -l options to specify the height a percentage\n  or as a number of lines.\n* Make window and session choice modes allow you to choose items in vi keys\n  mode (doh!). As a side-effect, this makes enter copy selection (as well\n  as C-w/M-w) when using emacs keys in copy mode. Reported by merdely.\n\n20 January 2009\n\n* Darwin support for automatic-rename from joshe; Darwin doesn't seem to have\n  a sane method of getting argv[0] and searching for the precise insane way\n  is too frustrating, so this just uses the executable name.\n* Try to change the window title to match the command running it in. This is\n  done by reading argv[0] from the process group leader of the group that owns\n  the tty (tcgetpgrp()). This can't be done portably so some OS-dependent code\n  is introduced (ugh); OpenBSD, FreeBSD and Linux are supported at the moment.\n\n  A new window flag, automatic-rename, is available: if this is set to off, the\n  window name is not changed. Specifying a name with the new-window,\n  new-session or rename-window commands will automatically set this flag to off\n  for the window in question. To disable it entirely set the option to off\n  globally (setw -g automatic-rename off).\n\n19 January 2009\n\n* Fix various stupid issues when the status line is turned off. Grr.\n* Use reverse attributes for clock and cursor, otherwise they do not\n  appear on black and white terminals.\n* An error in a command sequence now stops execution of that sequence.\n  Internally, each command code now passes a return code back rather than\n  talking to the calling client (if any) directly.\n* attach-session now tries to start the server if it isn't already started - if\n  no sessions are created in .tmux.conf this will cause an error.\n* Clean up starting server by making initial client get a special socketpair.\n\n18 January 2009\n\n* Unbreak UTF-8.\n* -a flag to next-window and previous-window to select the next or previous\n  window with activity or bell. Bound to M-n and M-p.\n* find-window command to search window names, titles and visible content (but\n  not history) for a string. If only one is found, the window is selected\n  otherwise a choice list is shown. This (as with the other choice commands)\n  only works from a key. Bound to \"f\" by default.\n* Cleaned up command printing code, also enclose arguments with spaces in \"s.\n* Added command sequences. These are entered by separating each argument by a ;\n  argument (spaces on both sides), for example:\n\n\tlsk ; lsc\n\n  To use a literal ; as the argument prefix it with \\, for example:\n\n\tbind x lsk \\; lsc\n\n  Commands are executed from left to right. Also note that command sequences do\n  not support repeat-time repetition unless all commands making up the sequence\n  support it.\n* suspend-client command to suspend a client. Don't try to background it\n  though...\n* Mark attached sessions in sessions lists. Suggested by Simon Kuhnle.\n\n17 January 2009\n\n* tmux 0.6 released.\n\n15 January 2009\n\n* Support #H for hostname and #S for session name in status-left/right.\n* Two new commands, choose-window and choose-session which work only when bound\n  to a key and allow the window or session to be selected from a list. These\n  are now bound to \"w\" and \"s\" instead of the list commands.\n\n14 January 2009\n\n* Rework the prefix-time stuff. The option is now called repeat-time and\n  defaults to 500 ms. It only applies to a small subset of commands, currently:\n  up-pane, down-pane, next-window, previous-window, resize-pane-up,\n  resize-pane-down. These are the commands for which it is obviously useful,\n  having it for everything else was just bloody annoying.\n* The alt-up and alt-down keys now resize a pane by five lines at a time.\n* switch-pane is now select-pane and requires -p to select a pane. The\n  \"o\" key binding is changed to down-pane.\n* up-pane and down-pane commands, bound to arrow up and down by default.\n* Multiple vertical window splitting. Minimum pane size is four lines, an\n  (unhelpful) error will be shown if attempting to split a window with less\n  that eight lines. If the window is resized, as many panes are shown as can\n  fit without reducing them below four lines. There is (currently!) not a way\n  to show a hidden pane without making the window larger.\n\n  Note the -p and -l options to split-window are now gone, these may reappear\n  once I think them through again.\n* Server locking on inactivity (lock-after-time) is now disabled by default.\n\n13 January 2009\n\n* kill-pane command.\n\n12 January 2009\n\n* command-prompt now accepts a single argument, a template string. Any\n  occurrences of %% in this string are replaced by whatever is entered at the\n  prompt and the result is executed as a command. This allows things like (now\n  bound by default):\n\n  \t bind , command-prompt \"rename-window %%\"\n\n  Or my favourite:\n\n         bind x command-prompt \"split-window 'man %%'\"\n\n* Option to set prefix time, allowing multiple commands to be entered without\n  pressing the prefix key again, so long as they each typed within this time of\n  each other.\n* Yet more hacks for key handling. Think it is just about working now.\n* Two commands, resize-pane-up and resize-pane-down to resize a pane.\n* Make the window pane code handle panes of different sizes, and add a -l\n  and -p arguments to split-window to specify the new window size in lines\n  or as a percentage.\n\n11 January 2009\n\n* Vertical window splitting. Currently can only split a window into two panes.\n  New split-window command splits (bound to \") and switch-pane command (bound to\n  o) switches between panes.\n\n  close-pane, swap-pane commands are to follow. Also to come are pane resizing,\n  &gt;2 panes, the ability to break a pane out to a full window and vice versa and\n  possibly horizontal splitting.\n\n  Panes are subelements of windows rather than being windows in their own\n  right. I tried to make them windows (so the splitting was at the session or\n  client level) but this rapidly became very complex and invasive. So in the\n  interests of having something working, I just made it so each window can have\n  two child processes instead of one (and it still took me 12 hours straight\n  coding). Now the concept is proven and much of the support code is there,\n  this may change in future if more flexibility is needed.\n* save-buffer command, from Tiago Cunha.\n\n10 January 2009\n\n* New option, lock-after-time. If there is no activity in the period specified\n  by this option (in seconds), tmux will lock the server. Default is 1800 (30\n  minutes), set to 0 to disable.\n* Server locking. Two new commands: set-password to set a password (a\n  preencrypted password may be specified with -c); and lock-server to lock the\n  server until the password is entered. Also an additional command line flag,\n  -U, to unlock from the shell. The default password is blank (any password\n  accepted). If specifying an encrypted password from encrypt(1) in .tmux.conf\n  with -c, don't forget to enclose it in single-quotes (') to prevent shell\n  variable expansion.\n* If a window is created from the command line, tmux will now use the same\n  current working directory for the new process. A new default-path option to\n  sets the working directory for processes created from keys or interactively\n  from the prompt.\n* New mode to display a large clock. Entered with clock-mode command (bound to\n  C-b t by default); two window options: clock-mode-colour and clock-mode-style\n  (12 or 24). This will probably be used as the basis for window locking.\n* New command, server-info, to show some server information and terminal\n  details.\n\n09 January 2009\n\n* Stop using ncurses variables and instead build a table of the codes we want\n  into an array for each terminal type. This makes the code a little more\n  untidy in places but gets rid of the awful global variables and calling\n  setterm all the time, and shoves all the ncurses-dependent mess into a single\n  file, tty-term.c. It also allows overriding single terminal codes, this is\n  used to fix rxvt on some platforms (where it is missing dch) and in future\n  may allow user customisation a la vim.\n* Update key handling code. Simplify, support ctrl properly and add a new\n  window option (xterm-keys) to output xterm key codes including ctrl and,\n  if available, alt and shift.\n\n08 January 2009\n\n* If built without DEBUG (the release versions), don't cause a fatal error if\n  the grid functions notice an input error, just log and ignore the\n  request. This might mean me getting shouted at less often when bugs kill\n  long-running sessions, at least in release versions.\n* Hopefully fix cursor out-of-bounds checking when writing to grid. When I\n  wrote the code I must have forgotten that the cursor can be one cell off the\n  right of the screen (yes, I know), so there were number of out-of-bounds/\n  overflow problems.\n\n07 January 2009\n\n* New flag to set and setw, -u, to unset an option (allowing it to inherit from)\n  the global options again.\n* Added more info messages for options changes.\n* A bit of tidying and reorganisation of options code.\n\n06 January 2009\n\n* Don't crash when backspacing if cursor is off the right of the screen,\n  reported by David Chisnall.\n* Complete words at any point inside command in prompt, also use option name\n  as well as command names.\n* Per-client prompt history of up to 100 items.\n* Use a splay tree for key bindings instead of an array. As a side-effect this\n  sorts them when listed.\n\n22 December 2008\n\n* Use the right keys for home and end.\n\n20 December 2008\n\n* Add vim mode for tmux configuration file to examples/, from Tiago Cunha.\n\n15 December 2008\n\n* New command, source-file (alias source), to load a configuration\n  file. Written by Tiago Cunha, many thanks.\n\n13 December 2008\n\n* Work around lack of dch. On Linux, the rxvt termcap doesn't have it (it is\n  lying, but we can't really start disbelieving termcaps...). This is a bit\n  horrible - I can see no way to do it without pretty much redrawing the whole\n  line, but it works...\n\n10 December 2008\n\n* glibc's getopt(3) is useless: it is not POSIX compliant without jumping\n  through non-portable hoops, and the method of resetting it is unclear (the\n  man page on my system says set optind to 1, but other sources say 0). So,\n  import OpenBSD's getopt_long.c into compat/ for use on Linux and use the\n  clearly documented optreset = optind = 1 method. This fixes some strange\n  issues with command parsing (getting the syntax wrong would prevent any\n  further commands being parsed).\n\n06 December 2008\n\n* Bring set/setw/show/showw into line with other commands. This means that by\n  default they now affect the current window (if any); the new -g flag must be\n  passed to set the global options. This changes the behaviour of set/show and\n  WILL BREAK CURRENT CONFIGURATIONS.\n\n  In summary, whether in the configuration file, the command prompt, or a key\n  binding, use -g to set a global option, use -t to specify a particular window\n  or session, or omit both to try and use the current window or session.\n\n  This makes set/show a bit of a pain but is the correct behaviour for\n  setw/showw and is the same as every other command, so we can put up with a\n  bit of pain for consistency.\n* Redo window options. They now work in the same way to session options with a\n  global options set. showw/setw commands now have similar syntax to show/set\n  (including the ability to use abbreviations).\n\n  PLEASE NOTE this includes the following configuration-breaking changes:\n\n  - remain-by-default is now GONE, use \"setw -g remain-on-exit\" to apply the\n    global window option instead;\n  - mode-keys is now a window option rather than session - use \"setw [-g]\n    mode-keys\" instead of set.\n\n  There are also some additions:\n\n  - message-fg and message-bg session options to control status line message\n    colours;\n  - mode-fg and mode-bg window options to set colours in window modes such as\n    copy mode.\n\n  The options code still a mess and now there is twice as much of it :-(.\n\n02 December 2008\n\n* Add support for including the window title in status-left or status-right\n  strings by including the character pair \"#T\". This may be prefixed with\n  a number to specify a maximum length, for example \"#24T\" to use at most\n  24 characters of the title.\n* Introduce two new options, status-left-length and status-right-length,\n  control the maximum length of left and right components of the status bar.\n* elinks (and possibly others) bypass the terminal and talk directly to X to\n  restore the window title when exiting. tmux can't know about this particular\n  bit of stupidity so the title ends up strange - the prefix isn't terribly\n  important and elinks is quite useful so just get rid of it.\n\n27 November 2008\n\n* Tweaks to support Dragonfly.\n\n17 November 2008\n\n* tmux 0.5 released.\n\n16 November 2008\n\n* New window option: \"utf8\"; this must be on (it is off by default) for UTF-8\n  to be parsed. The global/session option \"utf8-default\" controls the setting\n  for new windows.\n\n  This means that by default tmux does not handle UTF-8. To use UTF-8 by\n  default it is necessary to a) \"set utf8-default on\" in .tmux.conf b) start\n  tmux with -u on any terminal which support UTF-8.\n\n  It seems a bit unnecessary for this to be a per-window option but that is\n  the easiest way to do it, and it can't do any harm...\n* Enable default colours if op contains \\033[39;49m, based on a report from\n  fulvio ciriaco.\n\n12 November 2008\n\n* Keep stack of last windows rather than just most recent; based on a diff from\n  joshe.\n\n04 November 2008\n\n* Don't try to redraw status line when showing a prompt or message; if it does,\n  the status timer is never reset so it redraws on every loop. Spotted by\n  joshe.\n\n09 October 2008\n\n* Translate 256 colours into 16 if 256 is not available, same as screen does.\n* Better support for OSC command (only to set window title now), and also\n  support using APC for the same purpose (some Linux default shell profiles do\n  this).\n\n25 September 2008\n\n* Large internal rewrite to better support 256 colours and UTF-8. Screen data\n  is now stored as single two-way array of structures rather than as multiple\n  separate arrays. Also simplified a lot of code.\n\n  Only external changes are three new flags, -2, -d and -u, which force tmux to\n  assume the terminal supports 256 colours, default colours (useful for\n  xterm-256color which lacks the AX flag), or UTF-8 respectively.\n\n10 September 2008\n\n* Split off colour conversion code from screen code.\n\n09 September 2008\n\n* Initial UTF-8 support. A bit ugly and with a limit of 4096 UTF-8\n  characters per window.\n\n08 September 2008\n\n* 256 colour support. tmux attempts to autodetect the terminal by looking\n  both at what ncurses reports (usually wrong for xterm) and checking if\n  the TERM contains \"256col\". For xterm TERM=xterm-256color is needed (as\n  well as a build that support 256 colours); this seems to work for rxvt\n  as well. On non-256 colour terminals, high colours are translated to white\n  foreground and black background.\n\n28 August 2008\n\n* Support OS X/Darwin thanks to bsd-poll.c from OpenSSH. Also convert\n  from clock_gettime(2) to gettimeofday(2) as OS X doesn't support the\n  former; microsecond accuracy will have to be sufficient ;-).\n\n07 August 2008\n\n* Lose some unused/useless wrapper functions.\n\n25 July 2008\n\n* Shell variables may now be defined and used in configuration file. Define\n  variables with:\n\n\tVAR=1\n\n  And use with:\n\n        renamew ${VAR}\n\trenamew \"x${VAR}x\"\n\n Also some other fixes to make, for example, \"abc\"\"abc\" work similarly to\n the shell.\n\n24 July 2008\n\n* Finally lose inconsistently-used SCREEN_DEF* defines.\n* If cursor mode is on, switch the arrow keys from \\033[A to \\033OA.\n* Support the numeric keypad in both application and numbers mode. This is\n  different from screen which always keeps it in application mode.\n\n19 July 2008\n\n* Unbreak \"set status\" - tmux thought it was ambiguous, reported by rivo nurges.\n\n02 July 2008\n\n* Split vi and emacs mode keys into two tables and add an option (mode-keys)\n  to select between them. Default is emacs, use,\n\n     tmux set mode-keys vi\n\n  to change to vi.\n\n  vi mode uses space to start selection, enter to copy selection and escape\n  to clear selection.\n\n01 July 2008\n\n* Protocol versioning. Clients which identify as a different version from the\n  server will be rejected.\n* tmux 0.4 released.\n\n29 June 2008\n\n* Zombie windows. These are not closed when the child process dies. May be\n  set for a window with the new \"remain-on-exit\" option; the default setting\n  of this flag for new windows may be set with the \"remain-by-default\" session\n  option.\n\n  A window may be restarted with the respawn-window command:\n\n  \trespawn-window [-k] [command]\n\n  If -k is given, any existing process running in the window is killed;\n  if command is omitted, the same command as when the window was first\n  created is used.\n\n27 June 2008\n\n* Handle nonexistent session or client to -t properly.\n\n25 June 2008\n\n* select-prompt command to allow a window to be selected at a prompt. Only\n  windows in the current session may be selected. Bound to ' by default.\n  Suggested by merdely.\n* move-window command. Requested by merdely.\n* Support binding alt keys (prefixed with M-). Change default to use\n  C- for ctrl keys (^ is still accepted as an alternative).\n* Slim down default key bindings: support lowercase only.\n* Handle escaped keys properly (parse eg \\033b into a single key code) and\n  use this to change copy mode next/previous work to M-f and M-b to match\n  emacs.\n\n24 June 2008\n\n* Next word (C-n/w) and previous word (C-b/b) in copy mode.\n\n23 June 2008\n\n* list-commands command (alias lscm).\n* Split information about options into a table and use it to parse options\n  on input (allowing abbreviations) and to print them with show-options\n  (meaning that bell-action gets a proper string). This turned out a bit ugly\n  though :-/.\n\n22 June 2008\n\n* Do not translate black and white into default if the terminal supports\n  default colours. This was nice to force programs which didn't use default\n  colours to be properly transparent in rxvt/aterm windows with a background\n  image, but it causes trouble if someone redefines the default foreground and\n  background (to have black on white or something).\n\n21 June 2008\n\n* Naive tab completion in the command prompt. This only completes command\n  names if a) they are at the start of the text b) the cursor is at\n  the end of the text c) the text contains no spaces.\n* Only attempt to set the title where TERM looks like an xterm (contains\n  \"xterm\", \"rxvt\" or is \"screen\"). I hate this but I don't see a better way:\n  setting the title actually kills some other terminals pretty much dead.\n* Strip padding out of terminfo(5) strings. Currently the padding is just\n  ignored, this may need to be altered if there are any software terminals\n  out there that actually need it.\n\n20 June 2008\n\n* buffer-limit option to set maximum size of buffer stack. Default is 9.\n* Initial buffer improvements. Each session has a stack of buffers and each\n  buffer command takes a -b option to manipulate items on the stack. If -b\n  is omitted, the top entry is used. The following commands are currently\n  available:\n\n\tset-buffer [-b index] [-t target-session] string\n\tpaste-buffer [-d] [-b index] [-t target-window]\n\tdelete-buffer [-b index] [-t target-session]\n\tshow-buffers [-t target-session]\n\tshow-buffer [-b index] [-t target-session]\n\n  -d to paste-buffer deletes the buffer after pasting it.\n* New option, display-time, sets the time status line messages stay on screen\n  (unless a key is pressed). Set in milliseconds, default is 750 (0.75 seconds).\n  The timer is only checked every 100 ms or so.\n\n19 June 2008\n\n* Use \"status\" consistently for status line option, and prefix for \"prefix\" key\n  option.\n* Allow commands to be entered at a prompt. This is triggered with the\n  command-prompt command, bound to : by default.\n* Show status messages properly, without blocking the server.\n\n18 June 2008\n\n* New option, set-titles. On by default, this attempts to set the window title\n  using the \\e]2;...\\007 xterm code.\n\n  Note that elinks requires the STY environment variable (used by screen) to be\n  set before it will set the window title. So, if you want window titles set by\n  elinks, set STY before running it (any value will do). I can't do this for all\n  windows since setting it to an invalid value breaks screen.\n* Show arrows at either end of status line when scrolled if more windows\n  exist. Highlight the arrow if a hidden window has activity or bell.\n* Scroll the status line to show the current window if necessary. Also handle\n  windows smaller than needed better (show a blank status line instead of\n  hanging or crashing).\n\n17 June 2008\n\n* tmux 0.3 released.\n\n16 June 2008\n\n* Add some information messages when window options are changed, suggested by\n  Mike Erdely. Also add a -q command-line option to suppress them.\n* show-window-options (showw) command.\n\n15 June 2008\n\n* show-options (show) command to show one or all options.\n\n14 June 2008\n\n* New window options: force-width and force-height. This will force a window\n  to an arbitrary width and height (0 for the default unlimited). This is\n  neat for emacs which doesn't have a sensible way to force hard wrapping at 80\n  columns. Also, don't try to be clever and use clr_eol when redrawing the\n  whole screen, it causes trouble since the redraw functions are used to draw\n  the blank areas too.\n* Clear the blank area below windows properly when they are smaller than client,\n  also add an indicator line to show the vertical limit.\n* Don't die on empty strings in config file, reported by Will Maier.\n\n08 June 2008\n\n* Set socket mode +x if any sessions are attached and -x if not.\n\n07 June 2008\n\n* Make status-interval actually changeable.\n\n06 June 2008\n\n* New window option: aggressive-resize. Normally, windows are resized to the\n  size of the smallest attached session to which they are linked. This means a\n  window only changes size when sessions are detached or attached, or they are\n  linked or unlinked from a session. This flag changes a window to be the size\n  of the smallest attached session for which it is the current window - it is\n  resized every time a session changes to it or away from it. This is nice for\n  things that handle SIGWINCH well (like irssi) and bad for things like shells.\n* The server now exits when no sessions remain.\n* Fix bug with inserting characters with TERM=xterm-color.\n\n05 June 2008\n\n* Completely reorganise command parsing. Much more common code in cmd-generic.c\n  and a new way of specifying windows, clients or sessions. Now, most commands\n  take a -t argument, which specifies a client, a session, or a window target.\n  Clients and sessions are given alone (sessions are fnmatch(3)d and\n  clients currently not), windows are give by (client|session):index. For\n  example, if a user is in session \"1\" window 0 on /dev/ttypi, these should all\n  be equivalent:\n\n\ttmux renamew newname\t\t\t(current session and window)\n\ttmux renamew -t: newname\t\t(current session and window)\n\ttmux renamew -t:0 newname\t\t(current session, window 0)\n\ttmux renamew -t0 newname\t\t(current session, window 0)\n\ttmux renamew -t1:0 newname\t\t(session 1, window 0)\n\ttmux renamew -t1: newname\t\t(session 1's current window)\n\ttmux renamew -t/dev/ttypi newname\t(client /dev/ttypi's current\n\t\t\t\t\t\t session and window)\n\ttmux renamew -t/dev/ttypi: newname\t(client /dev/ttypi's current\n\t\t\t\t\t\t session and window)\n\ttmux renamew -t/dev/ttypi:0 newname\t(client /dev/ttypi's current\n\t\t\t\t\t\t session, window 0)\n\n  This does have some downsides, for example, having to use -t on selectw,\n\n\ttmux selectw -t7\n\n  is annoying. But then using non-flagged arguments would mean renaming the\n  current window would need to be something like:\n\n\ttmux renamew : newname\n\n  It might be better not to try and be so consistent; comments to the usual\n  address ;-).\n* Infrastructure for printing arguments in list-keys output. Easy ones only for\n  now.\n\n04 June 2008\n\n* Add some vi(1) key bindings in copy mode, and support binding ^[, ^\\, ^]\n  ^^ and ^_. Both from/prompted by Will Maier.\n* setw monitor-activity and set status without arguments now toggle the current\n  value; suggested by merdely.\n* New command set-window-option (alias setw) to set the single current window\n  option: monitor-activity to determine whether window activity is shown in\n  the status bar for that window (default off).\n* Change so active/bell windows are inverted in status line.\n* Activity monitoring - window with activity are marked in status line. No\n  way to disable this/filter windows yet.\n* Brought select-window command into line with everything else; it now uses\n  -i for the window index.\n* Strings to display on the left and right of the status bar may now be set\n  with the status-left and status-right options. These are passed through\n  strftime(3) before being displayed. The status bar is automatically updated\n  at an interval set by the status-interval option. The default is to display\n  nothing on the left and the date and time on the left; the default update\n  interval is 15 seconds.\n\n03 June 2008\n\n* Per session options. Setting options without specifying a session sets the\n  global options as normal (global options are inherited by all sessions);\n  passing -c or -s will set the option only for that session.\n* Because a client has a session attached, any command needing a session can\n  take a client and use its session. So, anything that used to accept -s now\n  accepts -c as well.\n* -s to specify session name now supports fnmatch(3) wildcards; if multiple\n  sessions are found, or if no -s is specified, the most newly created is used.\n* If no command is specified, assume new-session. As a byproduct, clean up\n  command default values into separate init functions.\n* kill-server command.\n\n02 June 2008\n\n* New command, start-server (alias \"start\"), to start the tmux server and do\n  nothing else. This is good if you have a configuration file which creates\n  windows or sessions (like me): in that case, starting the server the first\n  time tmux new is run is bad since it creates a new session and window (as\n  it is supposed to - starting the server is a side-effect).\n\n  Instead, I have a little script which does the equivalent of:\n\n  \ttmux has -s0 2&gt;/dev/null || tmux start\n  \ttmux attach -d -s0\n\n  And I use it to start the server if necessary and attach to my primary\n  session.\n* Basic configuration file in ~/.tmux.conf or specified with -f. This is file\n  contains a set of tmux commands that are run the first time the server is\n  started. The configuration commands are executed before any others, so\n  if you have a configuration file that contains:\n\n\tnew -d\n\tneww -s0\n\n  And you do the following without an existing server running:\n\n\ttmux new\n\n  You will end up with two sessions, session 0 with two windows (created by\n  the configuration file) and your client attached to session 1 with one\n  window (created by the command-line command). I'm not completely happy with\n  this, it seems a little non-obvious, but I haven't yet decided what to do\n  about it.\n\n  There is no environment variable handling or other special stuff yet.\n\n  In the future, it might be nice to be able to have per-session configuration\n  settings, probably by having conditionals in the file (so you could, for\n  example, have commands to define a particular window layout that would only\n  be invoked if you called tmux new -smysession and mysession did not already\n  exist).\n* BIG CHANGE: -s and -c to specify session name and client name are now passed\n  after the command rather than before it. So, for example:\n\n\ttmux -s0 neww\n\n  Becomes:\n\n\ttmux neww -s0\n\n  This is to allow them to be used in the (forthcoming) configuration file\n  THIS WILL BREAK ANY CURRENT SCRIPTS OR ALIASES USING -s OR -c.\n\n01 June 2008\n\n* Bug fix: don't die if -k passed to link-window and the destination doesn't\n  exist.\n* New command, send-keys, will send a set of keys to a window.\n\n31 May 2008\n\n* Fix so tmux doesn't hang if the initial window fails for some reason. This\n  was highlighted by problems on Darwin, thanks to Elias Pipping for the report\n  and access to a test account. (tmux still won't work on Darwin since its\n  poll(2) is broken.)\n\n02 January 2008\n\n* Don't attempt to reset the tty on exit if it has been closed externally.\n\n06 December 2007\n\n* Restore checks for required termcap entries and add a few more obvious\n  emulations.\n* Another major reorganisation, this time of screen handling. A new set of\n  functions, screen_write_*, are now used to write to a screen and a tty\n  simultaneously. These are used by the input parser to update the base\n  window screen and also by the different modes which now interpose their own\n  screen.\n\n30 November 2007\n\n* Support \\ek...\\e\\ to set window name.\n\n27 November 2007\n\n* Enable/disable mouse when asked, if terminal claims to support it. Mouse\n  sequences are just passed through unaltered for the moment.\n* Big internal reorganisation. Rather than leaving control of the tty solely in\n  the client and piping all data through a socket to it, change so that the\n  server opens the tty again and reads and writes to it directly. This avoids\n  a lot of buffering and copying. Also reorganise the redrawing stuff so that\n  everything goes through screen_draw_* - this makes the code simpler, but\n  still needs broken up more, and all the ways of writing to screens should be\n  more consistent.\n\n26 November 2007\n\n* Rather than shifting up one line at a time once the history is full,\n  shift by 10% of the history each time. This is faster.\n* Add ^A and ^E to copy mode to move to start-of-line/end-of-line.\n\n24 November 2007\n\n* Support for alt charset mode (VT100 graphics characters).\n\n23 November 2007\n\n* Mostly complete copy &amp; paste. Copy mode entered with C-b [ (copy-mode\n  command). In copy mode, arrow keys/page up/page down/hjkl/C-u/C-f navigate,\n  space or C-space starts selection, and enter or C-w copies and (important!)\n  exits copy mode. C-b ] (paste-buffer) pastes into current window. No\n  extra utility keys (bol/eol/clear selection/etc), only one single buffer,\n  and no buffer manipulation commands (clear/view/etc) yet. The code is also\n  fugly :-(.\n* history-limit option to set maximum history. Does not apply retroactively to\n  existing windows! Lines take up a variable amount of space, but a reasonable\n  guess for an 80-column terminal is 250 KB per 1000 lines (of history used,\n  an empty history takes no space).\n\n21 November 2007\n\n* Create every line as zero length and only expand it as data is written,\n  rather than creating at full size immediately.\n* Make command output (eg list-keys) go to a scrollable window similar to\n  scroll mode.\n* Redo screen redrawing so it is a) readable b) split into utility functions\n  that can be used outside screen.c. Use these to make scroll mode only\n  redraw what it has to which gets rid of irritating flickering status box and\n  makes it much faster.\n* Full line width memory and horizontal scrolling in history.\n* Initial support for scroll history. = to enter scrolling mode, and then\n  vi keys or up/down/pgup/pgdown to navigate. Q to exit. No horizontal history\n  yet (need per-line sizes) and a few kinks to be worked out (resizing while in\n  history mode will probably cause trouble).\n\n20 November 2007\n\n* Fix format string error with \"must specify a client\" message. Also\n  sprinkle some printflike tags.\n* tmux 0.1 released.\n\n17 November 2007\n\n* (nicm) Add -k option to link-window to kill target window if it exists.\n\n16 November 2007\n\n* (nicm) Split in-client display into two columns. This is a hack but not a lot\n  more so than that bit is already and it helps with lots of keys.\n* (nicm) switch-client command to switch client between different sessions. This\n  is pretty cool:\n\n\t$ tmux bind q switch 0\n\t$ tmux bind w switch 1\n\n  Then you can switch between sessions 0 and 1 with a key :-).\n* (nicm) Accept \"-c client-tty\" on command line to allow client manipulation\n  commands, and change detach-/refresh-session to detach-/refresh-client (this\n  loses the -a behaviour, but at some point -session versions may return, and\n  -c will allow fnmatch(3)).\n* (nicm) List available commands on ambiguous command.\n\n12 November 2007\n\n* (nicm) If the terminal supports default colours (AX present), force black\n  background and white foreground to default. This is useful on transparent\n  *terms for programs which don't do it themselves (like most(1)).\n* (nicm) Fill in the rest of the man page.\n* (nicm) kill-session command.\n\n09 November 2007\n\n* (nicm) C-space is now \"^ \" not \"^@\".\n* (nicm) Support tab (\\011).\n* (nicm) Initial man page outline.\n* (nicm) -V to show version.\n* (nicm) rename-session command.\n\n08 November 2007\n\n* (nicm) Check for required terminal capabilities on start.\n\n31 October 2007\n\n* (nicm) Linux port.\n\n30 October 2007\n\n* (nicm) swap-window command. Same as link-window but swaps windows.\n\n26 October 2007\n\n* (nicm) Saving scroll region on \\e7 causes problems with ncmpc so I guess\n  it is not required.\n* (nicm) unlink-window command.\n* (nicm) link-window command to link an existing window into another session\n  (or another index in the same session). Syntax:\n\n\ttmux -s dstname link-window [-i dstidx] srcname srcidx\n\n* (nicm) Redo window data structures. The global array remains, but each per-\n  session list is now a RB tree of winlink structures. This disassociates the\n  window index from the array size (allowing arbitrary indexes) which still\n  allowing windows to have multiple indexes.\n\n25 October 2007\n\n* (nicm) has-session command: checks if session exists.\n\n24 October 2007\n\n* (nicm) Support for \\e6n to request cursor position. resize(1) now works.\n* (nicm) Support for \\e7, \\e8 save/restore cursor and attribute sequences.\n  Currently don't save mode (probably should). Also change some cases where\n  out-of-bound values are ignored to limit them to within range (there are\n  others than need to be checked too).\n\n23 October 2007\n\n* (nicm) Lift limit on session name passed with -s.\n* (nicm) Show size in session/window lists.\n* (nicm) Pass tty up to server when client identifies and add a list-clients\n  command to list connected clients.\n\n20 October 2007\n\n* (nicm) Add default-command option and change default to be $SHELL rather than\n  $SHELL -l. Also try to read shell from passwd db if $SHELL isn't present.\n\n19 October 2007\n\n* (nicm) -n on new-session is now -s, and -n is now the initial window name.\n  This was documented but not implemented :-/.\n* (nicm) kill-window command, bound to &amp; by default (because it should be hard\n  to hit accidently).\n* (nicm) bell-style option with three choices: \"none\" completely ignore bell;\n  \"any\" pass through a bell in any window to current; \"current\" ignore bells\n  except in current window. This applies only to the bell terminal signal,\n  the status bar always reflects any bells.\n* (nicm) Refresh session command.\n\n12 October 2007\n\n* (nicm) Add a warning if $TMUX exists on new/attach.\n* (nicm) send-prefix command. Bound to C-b by default.\n* (nicm) set status, status-fg, status-bg commands. fg and bg are as a number\n  from 0 to 8 or a string (\"red\", \"blue\", etc). status may be 1/0, on/off,\n  yes/no.\n* (nicm) Make status line mark window in yellow on bell.\n\n04 October 2007\n\n* (nicm) -d option to attach to detach all other clients on the same session.\n* (nicm) Partial resizing support. Still buggy. A C-b S and back sometimes fixes\n  it when it goes wonky.\n* (mxey) Added my tmux start script as an example (examples/start-tmux.sh).\n* (mxey) New sessions can now be given a command for their first window.\n* (mxey) Fixed usage statement for new-window.\n* (nicm) attach-session (can't believe I forgot it until now!) and list-windows\n  commands.\n* (nicm) rename-window and select-window commands.\n* (nicm) set-option command (alias set): \"tmux set-option prefix ^A\".\n* (nicm) Key binding and unbinding is back.\n\n03 October 2007\n\n* (nicm) {new,next,last,previous}-window.\n* (nicm) Rewrite command handling so commands are much more generic and the\n  same commands are used for command line and keys (although most will probably\n  need to check how they are called). Currently incomplete (only new/detach/ls\n  implemented). Change: -s is now passed before command again!\n* (nicm) String number arguments. So you can do: tmux bind ^Q create \"blah\".\n* (nicm) Key binding. tmux bind key command [argument] and tmux unbind key.\n  Key names are in a table in key-string.c, plus A is A, ^A is ctrl-A.\n  Possible commands are in cmd.c (look at cmd_bind_table).\n* (nicm) Move command parsing into the client. Also rename some messages and\n  tidy up a few bits. Lots more tidying up needed :-/.\n\n02 October 2007\n\n* (nicm) Redraw client status lines on rename.\n* (nicm) Error on ambiguous command.\n\n01 October 2007\n\n* (nicm) Restore window title handling.\n* (nicm) Simple uncustomisable status line with window list.\n\n30 September 2007\n\n* (nicm) Window info command for debugging, C-b I.\n\n29 September 2007\n\n* (nicm) Deleting/inserting lines should follow scrolling region. Fix.\n* (nicm) Allow creation of detached sessions: \"tmux new-session -d\".\n* (nicm) Permit error messages to be passed back for transient clients like\n  rename. Also make rename -i work.\n* (nicm) Pass through bell in any window to current.\n\n28 September 2007\n\n* (nicm) Major rewrite of input parser:\n\t- Lose the old weirdness in favour of a state machine.\n\t- Merge in parsing from screen.c.\n\t- Split key parsing off into a separate file.\n  This is step one towards hopefully allowing a status line. It requires\n  that we output data as if the terminal had one line less than it really does -\n  a serious problem when it comes to things like scrolling. This change\n  consolidates all the range checking and limiting together which should make\n  it easier.\n* (mxey) Added window renaming, like \"tmux rename [-s session] [-i index] name\"\n\n27 September 2007\n\n* Split \"tmux list\" into \"tmux list-sessions\" (ls) and \"list-windows\" (lsw).\n* New command session selection:\n\t- if name is specified, look for it and use it if it exists, otherwise\n\t  error\n\t- if no name specified, try the current session from $TMUX\n\t- if $TMUX doesn't exist, and there is only one session, use it,\n\t  otherwise error\n\n26 September 2007\n\n* Add command aliases, so \"ls\" is an alias for \"list\".\n* Rename some commands and alter syntax to take options after a la CVS. Also\n  change some flags. So:\n\n\ttmux -s/socket -nabc new\n\n  Becomes:\n\n\ttmux -S/socket new -sabc\n\n* Major tidy and split of client/server code.\n\n22 September 2007\n\n* Window list command (C-b W). Started by Maximilian Gass, finished by me.\n\n20 September 2007\n\n* Specify meta via environment variable (META).\n* Record last window and ^L key to switch to it. Largely from Maximilian Gass.\n* Reset ignored signals in child after forkpty, makes ^C work.\n* Wrap on next/previous. From Maximilian Gass.\n\n19 September 2007\n\n* Don't renumber windows on close.\n\n28 August 2007\n\n* Scrolling region (\\e[r) support.\n\n27 August 2007\n\n* Change screen.c to work more logically and hopefully fix heap corruption.\n\n09 July 2007\n\n* Initial import to CVS. Basic functions are working, albeit with a couple of\n  showstopper memory bugs and many missing features. Detaching, reattaching,\n  creating new sessions, listing sessions work acceptably for using with shells.\n  Simple curses programs (top, systat, tetris) and more complicated ones (mutt,\n  emacs) that don't require scrolling regions (ESC[r) mostly work fine\n  (including mutt, emacs). No status bar yet and no key remapping or other\n  customisation.\n</p></body></div></body></html>"}, "15429367": {"score": 1, "comments": ["<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=15308824\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=15308824</a>"], "time": "2017-10-08 21:40:56", "url": "https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/there-never-was-real-tulip-fever-180964915/?no-ist", "text": "<html><body><div><div class=\"article-body pagination-first\">\n      \n      \n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  <p>When tulips came to the Netherlands, all the world went mad. A sailor who mistook a rare tulip bulb for an onion and ate it with his herring sandwich was charged with a felony and thrown in prison. A bulb named Semper Augustus, notable for its flame-like white and red petals, sold for more than the cost of a mansion in a fashionable Amsterdam neighborhood, complete with coach and garden. As the tulip market grew, speculation exploded, with traders offering exorbitant prices for bulbs that had yet to flower. And then, as any financial bubble will do, the tulip market imploded, sending traders of all incomes into ruin.</p>\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n\n    \n      \n        \n          <p class=\"associated-container\">\n            \n              \n            \n            \n\n            \n          </p>\n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n  <p>For decades, economists have pointed to 17th-century tulipmania as a warning about the perils of the free market. Writers and historians have reveled in the absurdity of the event. The incident even provides the backdrop for the new film <em>Tulip Fever</em>, based on a novel of the same name by Deborah Moggach.</p>\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  <p>The only problem: none of these stories are true.</p>\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  <p>What really happened and how did the story of Dutch tulip speculation get so distorted? Anne Goldgar discovered the historical reality when she dug into the archives to research her book, <a href=\"http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/T/bo5414939.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Tulipmania: Money, Honor, and Knowledge in the Dutch Golden Age</em></a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n  <p>\u201cI always joke that the book should be called \u2018Tulipmania: More Boring Than You Thought,\u2019\u201d says Goldgar, a professor of early modern history at King\u2019s College London. \u201cPeople are so interested in this incident because they think they can draw lessons from it. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessarily the case.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  <p>But before you even attempt to apply what happened in the Netherlands to more recent bubbles\u2014the <a href=\"http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/market-crash-cost-newton-fortune-180961655/\" target=\"_blank\">South Sea Bubble in 1700s England</a>, the 19th-century railway bubble, the <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2000/11/09/technology/overview/\" target=\"_blank\">dot-com bubble</a> and bitcoin are just a few comparisons Goldgar has seen\u2014you have to understand Dutch society at the turn of the 17th century.</p>\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  <p>For starters, the country experienced a major demographic shift during its war for independence from Spain, which began in the 1560s and continued into the 1600s. It was during this period that merchants arrived in port cities like Amsterdam, Haarlem and Delft and established trading outfits, including the famous Dutch East India Company. This explosion in international commerce brought enormous fortune to the Netherlands, despite the war. In their newly independent nation, the Dutch were mainly led by urban oligarchies comprised of wealthy merchants, unlike other European countries of the era, which were controlled by landed nobility. As Goldgar writes in her book, \u201cThe resultant new faces, new money and new ideas helped to revolutionize the Dutch economy in the late 16th century.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  <p>As the economy changed, so, too, did social interactions and cultural values. A growing interest in natural history and a fascination with the exotic among the merchant class meant that goods from the Ottoman Empire and farther east fetched high prices. The influx of these goods also drove men of all social classes to acquire expertise in newly in-demand areas. One example Goldgar gives is fish auctioneer Adriaen Coenen, whose watercolor-illustrated manuscript <a href=\"http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/distributed/W/bo3535777.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Whale Book</em></a> allowed him to actually meet the President of Holland. And when Dutch botanist Carolus Clusius established a botanical garden at the University of Leiden in the 1590s, the tulip quickly rose to a place of honor.</p>\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n  <p>Originally found growing wild in the valleys of the Tien Shan Mountains (at the border where China and Tibet meet Afghanistan and Russia), tulips were cultivated in Istanbul as early as 1055. By the 15th century, Sultan Mehmed II of the Ottoman Empire had so many flowers in his 12 gardens that he required a staff of 920 gardeners. Tulips were among the most prized flowers, eventually becoming a symbol of the Ottomans, writes gardening correspondent for <em>The Independent </em>Anna Pavord in <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=LeMRBAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=history+of+tulips&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjOzsKLqZbWAhUDSiYKHcpvDgsQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Tulip</em></a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  <p>The Dutch learned that tulips could be grown from seeds or buds that grew on the mother bulb; a bulb that grows from seed would take 7 to 12 years before flowering, but a bulb itself could flower the very next year. Of particular interest to Clusius and other tulip traders were \u201cbroken bulbs\u201d\u2014tulips whose petals showed a striped, multicolor pattern rather than a single solid color. The effect was unpredictable, but the growing demand for these rare, \u201cbroken bulb\u201d tulips led naturalists to study ways to reproduce them. (The pattern was later discovered to be the result of a mosaic virus that actually makes the bulbs sickly and less likely to reproduce.) \u201cThe high market price for tulips to which the current version of tulipmania refers were prices for particularly beautiful broken bulbs,\u201d <a href=\"https://ms.mcmaster.ca/~grasselli/Garber89.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">writes economist Peter Garber</a>. \u201cSince breaking was unpredictable, some have characterized tulipmania among growers as a gamble, with growers vying to produce better and more bizarre variegations and feathering.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  <p>After all the money Dutch speculators spent on the bulbs, they only produced flowers for about a week\u2014but for tulip lovers, that week was a glorious one. \u201cAs luxury objects, tulips fit well into a culture of both abundant capital and new cosmopolitanism,\u201d Goldgar writes. Tulips required expertise, an appreciation of beauty and the exotic, and, of course, an abundance of money.</p>\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  <p>Here\u2019s where the myth comes into play. According to popular legend, the tulip craze took hold of all levels of Dutch society in the 1630s. \u201cThe rage among the Dutch to possess them was so great that the ordinary industry of the country was neglected, and the population, even to its lowest dregs, embarked in the tulip trade,\u201d wrote Scottish journalist Charles Mackay in his popular 1841 work <a href=\"http://www.gutenberg.org/files/24518/24518-h/dvi.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds</em></a>. According to this narrative, everyone from the wealthiest merchants to the poorest chimney sweeps jumped into the tulip fray, buying bulbs at high prices and selling them for even more. Companies formed just to deal with the tulip trade, which reached a fever pitch in late 1636. But by February 1637, the bottom fell out of the market. More and more people defaulted on their agreement to buy the tulips at the prices they\u2019d promised, and the traders who had already made their payments were left in debt or bankrupted. At least that\u2019s what has always been claimed.</p>\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  <p>In fact, \u201cThere weren\u2019t that many people involved and the economic repercussions were pretty minor,\u201d Goldgar says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t find anybody that went bankrupt. If there had been really a wholesale destruction of the economy as the myth suggests, that would\u2019ve been a much harder thing to face.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  <p>That\u2019s not to say that everything about the story is wrong; merchants really did engage in a frantic tulip trade, and they paid incredibly high prices for some bulbs. And when a number of buyers announced they couldn\u2019t pay the high price previously agreed upon, the market did fall apart and cause a small crisis\u2014but only because it undermined social expectations.</p>\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  <p>\u201cIn this case it was very difficult to deal with the fact that almost all of your relationships are based on trust, and people said, \u2018I don\u2019t care that I said I\u2019m going to buy this thing, I don\u2019t want it anymore and I\u2019m not going to pay for it.\u2019 There was really no mechanism to make people pay because the courts were unwilling to get involved,\u201d Goldgar says.</p>\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  <p>But the trade didn\u2019t affect all levels of society, and it didn\u2019t cause the collapse of industry in Amsterdam and elsewhere. As Garber, the economist, writes, \u201cWhile the lack of data precludes a solid conclusion, the results of the study indicate that the bulb speculation was not obvious madness.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  <p>So if tulipmania wasn\u2019t actually a calamity, why was it made out to be one? We have tetchy Christian moralists to blame for that. With great wealth comes great social anxiety, or as historian Simon Schama writes in <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=L8W9oB6Ab8sC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=the+embarrassment+of+riches&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjT09DU9ZPWAhUK5SYKHWI_D4gQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Embarrassment of Riches: An Interpretation of Dutch Culture in the Golden Age</em></a>, \u201cThe prodigious quality of their success went to their heads, but it also made them a bit queasy.\u201d All the outlandish stories of economic ruin, of an innocent sailor thrown in prison for eating a tulip bulb, of chimney sweeps wading into the market in hopes of striking it rich\u2014those come from propaganda pamphlets published by Dutch Calvinists worried that the tulip-propelled consumerism boom would lead to societal decay. Their insistence that such great wealth was ungodly has even stayed with us to this day.</p>\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  <p>\u201cSome of the stuff hasn\u2019t lasted, like the idea that God punishes people who are overreaching by causing them to have the plague. That\u2019s one of the things people said in the 1630s,\u201d Goldgar says. \u201cBut the idea that you get punished if you overreach? You still hear that. It\u2019s all, \u2018pride goes before the fall.\u2019\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  <p>Goldgar doesn\u2019t begrudge novelists and filmmakers for taking liberties with the past. It\u2019s only when historians and economists neglect to do their research that she gets irked. She herself didn\u2019t set out to be a mythbuster\u2014she only stumbled upon the truth when she sat down to look through old documentation of the popular legend. \u201cI had no way of knowing this existed before I started reading these documents,\u201d Goldgar says. \u201cThat was an unexpected treasure.\u201d</p>\n\n      \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    </div>\n\n    \n      \n        \n          \n        \n      \n    \n\n    \n\n    </div></body></html>"}, "15430094": {"score": 1, "comments": [], "time": "2017-10-09 00:28:55", "url": "http://pokerqq81.online/capsa-susun-kaskus-indonesia/", "text": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content\">&#13;\n\t\t<h1><strong>Capsa Susun Kaskus Indonesia Terpercaya</strong></h1>\n<p><strong>Agen judi capsa susun kaskus</strong> Indonesia terpercaya adalah sebuah tempat pedaftaran yang paling aman saat ini.

But in this case, the plants have been modified with genes from a different banana variety.</p> <p>An insidious fungus known as fusarium wilt has wiped out tens of thousands of acres of Cavendish plantations in Australia and Southeast Asia over the past decade. And the fungus recently gained a foothold in Africa and the Middle East, hitching a ride on the boots of workers helping to establish new plantations. Scientists say Latin America, the source of virtually all the bananas eaten in the United States, is next.</p> <p>No other variety of banana combines the sweetness and suitability for packing and export of the Cavendish. If the Humpty Doo experiment \u2014 or simultaneous efforts with conventional breeding techniques \u2014 don\u2019t bring positive results, scientists say we could be looking at a future where bananas all but disappear from store shelves.</p> <p>\u201cThese recent outbreaks confirmed that this thing does move,\u201d said plant pathologist Randy \u00adPloetz of the University of Florida, who first identified the fungus in 1989 in samples from Taiwan. Ever since, banana farmers have been trying to escape the effects of fusarium wilt, also known as Panama disease Tropical Race 4, or TR4. Fungicides and fumigants are useless against it. It\u2019s extremely contagious, and it can lie dormant for decades, tricking farmers into thinking they\u2019ve eliminated the pathogen, only to find plants rotting from the inside.</p><p/> <p>Once TR4 hits a banana farm, the only recourse is to eradicate all the plants and start over. It\u2019s possible, Ploetz said, that in a few years, \u201caffected plantations aren\u2019t going to be able to grow anything, because the replacement is not there.\u201d</p> <p class=\"subhead\">Foiled efforts</p> <p>For decades, biotech researchers and conventional breeders were foiled in their efforts to bring disease resistance to the Cavendish or to hybridize a replacement for the thick-skinned, slow-ripening variety that dominates banana exports, a <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/resources/infographics/infographics-details/en/c/297695/\" shape=\"rect\">$12.4\u00a0billion global business.</a> </p> <p>Soon after TR4 was identified, banana farmers had reported that a subspecies of the <i>Musa acuminata</i> variety of sweet bananas, which grows in the wild across Malaysia and Indonesia, was \u201cgrowing happily in plantations devastated by TR4,\u201d said James Dale, a professor of biotechnology at Queensland University of Technology in Australia. </p> <p>It took years to isolate the gene responsible for the resistance. Then, in 2004, a breakthrough: Dale\u2019s lab identified candidate genes worth testing. Over three more years of painstaking work, Dale inserted genes from the M. acuminata subspecies into cells from a Cavendish, developing them first in tiny test tubes, then growing whole plants. It takes about a year to grow a plant with roots that can be placed in the soil.</p> <p>But despite the clear and present danger of TR4, no one wanted to pay for a field trial; banana producers mistakenly believed they could manage the disease and keep it in check. So it was another three or four years before Dale could cobble together funding and find a facility where he could grow the plants to produce transgenic bananas. He was able to plant a small field trial in 2012, which lasted three years.</p> <p>Results from that initial trial \u201cwere extremely positive,\u201d he said, with four of six plant lines cultivated from a single cell showing resistance after researchers grew them and introduced TR4. \u201cWhen you genetically modify a plant, it\u2019s very common to get such variation, but four out of six is amazing.\u201d On the basis of that initial trial, Dale and his colleagues will be expanding the test to thousands of samples, planting them over three years.</p> <p class=\"subhead\">Near extinction</p> <p>Dale\u2019s project may be the best hope science now has for making the Cavendish resistant to TR4 without eliminating taste, texture and other characteristics that make it so appealing and commercially successful.</p><p/> <p>Botanists from the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, and agricultural research organizations from France to Honduras to Malaysia are collecting samples of wild bananas to see whether, like Dale\u2019s M. acuminata variety, they possess resistance to TR4. Those that do are then bred with Cavendish with the hope that the resistance can be introduced to the Cavendish without changing it.</p> <p>Ploetz is optimistic about Dale\u2019s trial, but he\u2019s not peeling his bananas before they\u2019re ripe. He thinks Dale needs \u201cto test this new [genetically modified fruit] in different environments and see the effects on yield\u201d and other factors, he said.</p> <p>The banana industry has seen this all before. In the early 20th century, the banana most commonly sold and eaten around the world was the Gros Michel, a short, uncurved and somewhat stubby cultivar.</p> <p>But a fungus known as Tropical Race 1 \u2014 or TR1 \u2014 drove it nearly to extinction in the 1950s. Cavendish, a variety from China found growing in a hothouse belonging to England\u2019s Duke of Devonshire, was discovered to be resistant to TR1 while possessing its same durability for shipping. The ordinary bananas we find in stores today are all clones of the duke\u2019s plant. </p> <p class=\"subhead\">The duke\u2019s banana</p> <p>Dale initially tried using genes from other plants and even a worm to reprogram the Cavendish not to succumb to the cell death that TR4 induces. But following the reports of M. acuminata\u2019s resistance to TR4, he cast aside the strategy, knowing that a banana modified with a gene from another kind of banana would be a far more palatable idea to consumers.</p> <p>Ironically, a major obstacle to replacing today\u2019s Cavendish with a TR4-resistant strain is the banana industry, which for the most part has dropped out of doing research, says Ploetz. William Goldfield, director of corporate communications for Dole Food, one of the largest producers and importers of bananas, said in an email that the company is \u201clooking at how to develop a disease resistant banana through crop improvement and plant breeding methods,\u201d but he didn\u2019t go into specifics. Requests for comment from the three other top banana producers went unanswered.</p> <p>The result, Ploetz says, is that very few scientists have been focusing on the TR4 problem directly.</p> <p>Which means that even if Dale\u2019s transgenic experiment in Humpty Doo is successful, the TR4 fungus\u2019s march to Latin America may be inevitable. </p> <p>Breakfast may never be the same.</p> <p> <i>Correction: Due to an editing error, a headline on an earlier version of this article described the disease as viral rather than fungal.</i> </p> <p channel=\"wp.com\" class=\"interstitial-link\">Read more</p> <p channel=\"wp.com\" class=\"interstitial-link\"> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2017/01/19/the-world-may-see-a-mass-extinction-of-primates-if-humans-dont-act/?utm_term=.cba0c8cb9724\" shape=\"rect\">The world could see a mass extinction of primates if humans odn\u2019t act</a> </p> <p channel=\"wp.com\" class=\"interstitial-link\">I<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/is-sugar-a-toxin-experts-debate-the-role-of-fructose-in-our-obesity-epidemic/2013/08/30/58a906d6-f952-11e2-afc1-c850c6ee5af8_story.html?utm_term=.493a4cfd542f\" shape=\"rect\">s sugar a toxin?

It was fascinating experience.  Before, I only knew of IKEA abstractly from the jokes &amp; memes about their furniture being impossible to assemble.<p>Actually walking through the place was extremely interesting.  Observations...<p>- it was the busiest furniture store I&#x27;ve ever been in for a non-holiday shopping day.  I&#x27;ve never seen a Rooms-to-Go that busy.<p>- the walkways are deliberately zig-zagged in serpentine fashion around the showroom.  I likened it to museum exhibits (especially traveling exhibits) or Disney venues that move people through a space in sequential fashion.  For people already familiar with showroom, they can go through the shortcut doors in the middle of room.  Even little things like the arrows on the ground were unique; instead of being painted on or vinyl adhesive, the arrows are actually lit from cans above your head.<p>- the Ikea restaurant was actually full.  Costco would be another rare example of the food court being full.  Most restaurants in retail stores are usually empty and a mind-boggling waste of floor space.  E.g. the restaurants inside Fry&#x27;s Electronics and Macy&#x27;s department store are always empty; you also knew Borders bookstore was dying when you saw nobody sitting in the store&#x27;s coffee shop.<p>- the housewares seem to be a good value.  E.g. The 1-quart hermetic jars at ContainerStore were $6.99 but the equivalent at Ikea was $2.99.[1][2]  I chuckled when I noticed that even the jars were do-it-yourself: you had to install the rubber ring on the lid!  I think lots of customers would be willing to do that to save $4.00.<p>I bought most of my furniture many years ago from Ethan Allen but I walked away from Ikea totally impressed their retail concept and presentation.  They hit the sweet spot combination of aesthetics + DIY + price.<p>As for the article, I noticed that many hobbies (e.g. sewing and crafting) have converged on Ikea as the common-denominator for organization.  The analogy of Ikea carcasses as a &quot;platform&quot; makes perfect sense.  E.g. there&#x27;s a company that makes storage displays to subdivide the Ikea cubes.[3]  Ikea is the closest thing in the furniture industry to have &quot;standardized pieces&quot; for others to build on.<p>Ikea is not the only place to buy DIY ready-to-assembly furniture.  Home Depot, Lowes, and Office Depot have particle board cubes as well.  The difference is that IKEA is very standardized with long-running product lines (more than a decade).  You can build out in incremental steps as the budget allows.  You can buy one cube or drawer cabinet from Ikea and 5 years later, you add another cube that matches.  Home Depot and Lowes will have &quot;flavor-of-the-month&quot; storage products from different vendors depending on whatever contracts were favorable at the time.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.containerstore.com&#x2F;s&#x2F;kilner-round-hermetic-glass-jars&#x2F;d?productId=10036769\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.containerstore.com&#x2F;s&#x2F;kilner-round-hermetic-glass...</a><p>[2] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ikea.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;en&#x2F;catalog&#x2F;products&#x2F;90227985&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ikea.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;en&#x2F;catalog&#x2F;products&#x2F;90227985&#x2F;</a><p>[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stampnstorage.com&#x2F;storage-for-ikea&#x2F;?sort=pricedesc\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stampnstorage.com&#x2F;storage-for-ikea&#x2F;?sort=pricede...</a>", "&gt; the walkways are deliberately zig-zagged in serpentine fashion around the showroom.<p>Yes, they try to make people go through everything to increase the chance of them buying something on an impulse, I guess.<p>&gt; the housewares seem to be a good value.

I think lots of customers would be willing to do that to save $4.00.<p>You mean the little rectangular glass things with plastic lids? In my experience the hinges on the lids tend to come off if the lid is even a little bit off-center when closing. And the porcelain things (plates, mugs, ...) have quite poor &quot;glassing&quot; (or whatever the term is), they won&#x27;t last very long. Go to the Ikea restaurant and take a look at the plates there for an example..<p>Now I&#x27;m not saying everything they do is crap.

This post, however, was 98% written before both Kyle\u2019s and Greg\u2019s posts, but their posts got me to accelerate the completion of my analysis and publish it now.)</span></div>\n<b><br/></b>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">\n<span>Seven years ago, I</span><a href=\"http://dbmsmusings.blogspot.com/2010/04/problems-with-cap-and-yahoos-little.html\"><span> </span><span>introduced the PACELC theorem</span></a><span> as a mechanism to more clearly explain the consistency tradeoffs in building distributed systems. At that time, many people were familiar with the consistency vs. availability trade-off that was made well-known by the CAP theorem. However, it was common amongst people unfamiliar with the details of CAP theorem to believe that this tradeoff is always present in a distributed system. However, the truth is that the CAP consistency-availability tradeoff actually describes a very rare corner case. Only when there is an actual network partition --- an increasingly unusual event in modern day infrastructures --- \u00a0does the consistency-availability tradeoff present itself. At all other times, it is possible to be both available and consistent. Nonetheless, many systems choose not to be fully consistent at all times. The reason for this has nothing to do with the CAP tradeoff. Instead, there is a separate latency vs. consistency tradeoff. Enforcing consistency requires either (1) synchronization messages between machines that must remain consistent with each other or (2) all requests involving a particular data item to be served by a single master for that data item instead of the closest replica to the location where the request originates. Both of these options come with a latency cost. By relaxing consistency and serving reads and writes directly from a closest replica (without synchronization with other replicas), latency can be improved --- sometimes by an order of magnitude.</span></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<span>Therefore, I felt that it was important to clearly tease apart these separate consistency tradeoffs. This led to the PACELC theorem: if there is a partition (P), how does the system trade off availability and consistency (A and C); else (E), when the system is running normally in the absence of partitions, how does the system trade off latency (L) and consistency (C)?</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<span/></p>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">\n<span>In general, the PACELC theorem leads to four categories of systems: PC/EC, PA/EL, PC/EL, and PA/EC. However, in practice, an application will either go to the effort of building on top of a reduced consistency system or it will not. If it goes to this effort, it stands to benefit in two areas: availability upon a partition, and latency in everyday operation. It is unusual for a system to go to this effort and choose only to attain benefit in one area. Hence, two of these four categories are more common than the other two: PC/EC systems designed for applications that can never sacrifice consistency, and PA/EL systems that are designed for applications that are capable of being built over a reduced consistency system. Despite being less common, PACELC nonetheless theorizes about the existence of PC/EL and PA/EC systems. At the time when I originally introduced PACELC, I gave the example of PNUTS as a PC/EL system. However, I could not think of any good examples of PA/EC systems. Even in</span><a href=\"http://cs-www.cs.yale.edu/homes/dna/papers/abadi-pacelc.pdf\"><span> </span><span>my extended article on PACELC</span></a><span> in the CAP-anniversary edition of IEEE Computer, I only gave a somewhat hand-wavey example of a PA/EC system.</span></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<span/></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<span>The basic problem with PA/EC systems is the following: although partitions are a rare event, they are not impossible. Any application built on top of a PA system must have mechanisms in place to deal with inconsistencies that arise during these partition events. But once they have these mechanisms in place, why not benefit during normal operation and get better latency as well?</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<span/></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<span>Over the past few weeks, I have been looking more deeply at the In-Memory Data Grid (\u201cIMDG\u201d) market, and took an especially deep dive into Hazelcast, a ubiquitous open source implementation of a IMDG, with hundreds of thousands of in production deployments. It turns out that Hazelcast (and, indeed, most of the in-memory data grid industry) is a real implementation of the mythical PA/EC system.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<span>In order to understand why PA/EC makes sense for Hazelcast and other IMDGs, we need to first discuss some background material on (1) Hazelcast use cases, (2) data replication and (3) PACELC. </span></p>\n<b><br/></b>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<span>Hazelcast use cases</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<span>The most common use case for Hazelcast is the following. Let\u2019s say that you write a Java program that stores and manipulates data inside popular Java collections and data structures, e.g., Queue, Map, AtomicLong, or Multimap. You may want to run this program in multiple different clients, all accessing the same Java collections and data structures. Furthermore, these data structures may get so large that they cannot fit in memory on a single server. Hazelcast comes to the rescue --- it provides a distributed implementation of these Java data structures, thereby enabling scalable utilization of them. Users interact with Hazelcast the same way that they interacted with their local data structures, but behind the scenes, Hazelcast is distributing and replicating them across a cluster of machines.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<span>The vast majority of Hazelcast use cases are within a single computing cluster. Both the client programs and the Hazelcast data structures are located in the same physical region.</span></p>\n<b><br/></b>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<span>Data replication</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<span>In general, any arbitrary system may choose to replicate data for one of two primary reasons: Either they want to improve fault tolerance (if a server containing some of the data fails, a replica server can be accessed instead), or they want to improve request latency (messages that have to travel farther distances take longer to transmit; therefore, having a replica of the data \u201cnear\u201d locations from which they are typically accessed can improve request latency). </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<span>As mentioned above, in-memory data grids are typically running in the same region as the clients which access them. Therefore, only the first reason to replicate data (fault tolerance) applies. (This reason alone is enough to justify the costs of replication in any scalable system. The more physical machines that exist in the system, the more likely it is that at least one machine will fail at any given point in time. Therefore, the bigger the system, the more you need to replicate for fault tolerance).</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<span>If the replicas only exist for fault tolerance and not for performance, there is no fundamental requirement to ever access them except in the case of a failure. All reads and writes can be directed to the primary copy of any data item, with the replicas only ever accessed if the primary is not available. (In such a scenario, it is a good idea to mix primary and replica partitions on servers across the cluster, in order to prevent underutilization of server resources.) If all reads and writes go to the same location, this leads to 100% consistency and linearizability (in the absence of failures) since it is easy for a single server to ensure that reads reflect the most recent writes.</span></p>\n<b><br/></b>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<span>What this means for PACELC</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<span>Recall what I wrote above about the latency vs. consistency tradeoff: \u201cEnforcing consistency requires either (1) synchronization messages between machines that must remain consistent with each other or (2)\u00a0<span>all requests involving a particular data item to be served by a single master for that data item instead of the closest replica to the location</span>\u00a0where the request originates. Both of these options come with a latency cost.\u201d In truth, option (2) does not come with a latency cost when all requests originate from a location closest to the master replica. It\u2019s only when messages travel for longer than the distance to the nearest replica where a cost materializes. In order words, there is no consistency vs. latency tradeoff in the typical Hazelcast use case.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<span>Thus, we should clarify at this point that the PACELC theorem assumes that requests may originate from any arbitrary location. The ELC part of PACELC disappears if all requests come from the same location. I would argue that the CAP theorem makes the same assumption, but such an argument is not as straightforward, and requires a refined discussion about the CAP theorem which is outside scope of this particular blog post.</span></p>\n<b><br/></b>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<span>Failures and partitions</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<span>Up until now, we have said that as long as the master node does not fail, if it serves all reads and writes, then full consistency is achieved. The obvious next question is: what happens if the master node fails and a new master takes over? In such a scenario, the ability of the system to maintain consistency depends on how replication is performed. If replication was asynchronous, then consistency cannot be guaranteed, since some updates may have been performed on the old master, but had not yet been replicated to the new master before the old master failed. If all data had been synchronously replicated to the new master, then full consistency can still be guaranteed. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<span>A failed node is logically equivalent to a partition where the failed node is located in one partition and every other node is in the other partition, and all client requests can reach the second partition but not the first. If the failed node is the master node, and replication was asynchronous, then both the CAP theorem and the PAC part of PACELC state that there are only two choices: quiesce the entire system since the only consistent copy is not accessible (i.e. choosing consistency over availability), or serve reads and writes from nodes in the available partition (i.e. choosing availability over consistency). \u00a0</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<span>Hazelcast by default uses \u201csynchronous\u201d replication, which is actually an interesting hybrid between asynchronous and synchronous replication. The master asynchronously sends the writes to the replicas, and each replica acknowledges these writes to the client. The client synchronously waits for these acknowledgments before returning from the call. However, if the requisite number of acknowledgments do not arrive before the end of a time out period, the call either returns with the write succeeding or throws an exception, depending on configuration. If Hazelcast had been configured to throw an exception, the client can retry the operation. \u00a0Hazelcast also has an anti-entropy algorithm that works offline to re-synchronize replicas with the master to repair missed replications. However, either way --- until the point where the missed replication has been repaired either through the anti-entropy algorithm or through a client retry, the system is temporarily in a state where the write has succeeded on the master but not on at least one replica. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<span>In addition to the hybrid synchronous algorithm described above, Hazelcast also can be configured to use standard asynchronous replication. When configured in this way, the client does not wait for acknowledgments from the replicas before returning from the call. Thus, updates that failed to get replicated will go undetected until the anti-entropy algorithm identifies and repairs the missed replication. \u00a0</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<span>Thus, either way --- whether Hazelcast is configured to use standard asynchronous replication or to use the default hybrid \u201csynchronous\u201d model --- it is possible for the write call to return with the write only succeeding on the master. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<span>If the master node fails, Hazelcast selects a new master to serve reads and writes, even though (as we just mentioned) it is possible that the new master does not have all the writes from the original master. If there is a network partition, the original master will remain the master for its partition, but the other partition will select its own master. Again, this second master may not have all the writes from the original master. Furthermore, a full split brain situation may occur, where the masters for the two different partitions independently accept writes to their partition, thereby causing the partitions to diverge further. However, Hazelcast does have a \u201csplit brain protection\u201d feature that prevents significant divergence. The way this feature works is that the system can be configured to define a minimum size for read and write operations. If this minimum size is set to be larger than half of the size of the cluster, then the smaller partition will not accept reads and writes, which prevents further divergence from the larger partition. However, it can take 10s of seconds for the smaller partition to realize how small it is (although Hazelcast claims it will be much faster than this in 3.9.1 and 3.10). Thus there is a delay before the split brain protection kicks in, and the partitions can diverge during this delay period. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<span>The bottom line here is that both if the master fails and also in the (rare) case of a network partition, a new master is selected that may not have all the updates from the original master. The system always remains available, but the second master is allowed to temporarily diverge from the original master. Thus, Hazelcast is PA/EC in PACELC. If the master has failed or partitioned, Hazelcast choses availability over consistency. However, in the absence of failures or partitions, Hazelcast is fully consistent. (As mentioned above, Hazelcast also achieves low latency in the absence of failures or partitions in their primary use case. However, it is appropriate to label Hazelcast EC rather than EL since if a request were to theoretically originate in a location that is far from the master, it would still choose consistency over latency and serve the request from the master.)</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<span>Indeed, any system that that serves reads and writes from the master, but elects a new master upon a failure, where this new master is not 100% guaranteed to have seen all of the writes from the original master, will be PA/EC in PACELC. So the PA/EC category is larger than I originally had expected.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<span>I would still argue, however, that PA/EC systems are fundamentally confusing to the end user. If the system cannot guarantee consistency in all cases, then the end user is forced to handle cases of inconsistency in application logic. And once they have the code written to handle these cases (e.g., by including merge functions that resolve situations where replicas may diverge), then the value of the system being consistent in the absence of failures or partitions is significantly reduced. PA/EC systems thus only make sense for applications for which availability takes priority over consistency, but where the code that handles inconsistencies needs to be run as infrequently as possible --- e.g. when the code involves a real world charge (such as refunding a customer\u2019s account) or significant performance costs. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<span>Since not all applications fit into the above category, I suspect that many PA/EC systems will have settings to either increase consistency in order to become fully consistent (i.e. become PC instead of PA) or reduce consistency guarantees in the \u201celse case\u201d (i.e., become EL instead of EC). </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<span>Indeed, Hazelcast is such a system and can be configured to be EL rather than EC. There are several ways to accomplish this, but the primary mechanism is through their Near Cache feature. Near Cache is a client side cache of recently accessed data items. If the data items stored in the Near Cache are updated by a different client, these changes are not synchronously replicated to the first client\u2019s Near Cache. Hence, the Near Cache is not kept consistent with the master version of the data (instead it is \u201ceventually consistent\u201d). However, reads by the client are served by its Near Cache if a copy of the data item to be read is stored there. Therefore, excellent latency (less than one microsecond) can be achieved at the cost of consistency --- EL in PACELC. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<span>Furthermore, Hazelcast also supports replication of clusters over a WAN. For example, in a disaster recovery use case, all writes go to the primary cluster, and they are asynchronously replicated to a backup cluster. Alternatively, both clusters can accept writes, and they are asynchronously replicated to the other cluster (the application is responsible for resolving conflicts of conflicting writes to the different clusters using a conflict resolution strategy registered with Hazelcast). Unlike what we discussed earlier, in this case read requests may originate from arbitrary locations rather than always from a location near the master.

It also substitutes cheap\n  digital goods over more expensive physical ones. For instance,\n  people stop paying \u00c2\u00a320 every month for a CD when they start\n  paying \u00c2\u00a310 a month for endless music from Spotify. The result is\n  that businesses are aggressively driving down their own prices\n  because consumers simply won't go to the ones that charge more,\n  and are no longer trapped into shopping in their own\n  neighbourhoods. Sweden is so advanced as a digital economy that\n  it may be importing its own deflation via digital shopping,\n  Pomeroy argued.\n</p>\n  <p>\n  At the same time, the <a href=\"http://uk.businessinsider.com/gig-economy-milton-friedman-full-employment-wage-growth-2017-8\">\n  app-based gig economy has kept wage inflation low</a> by turning\n  demand for labour on and off like a light switch.

Another senior ministry official, Choe Kang-il, insisted that North Korea had provided excellent care and spent \u201call the money for nursing\u201d him.</p><p class=\"p-block\">Something in me snapped. I asked how North Koreans could possibly boast about their spending on a young man when he was in a coma only because of them. Choe replied just as hotly that Warmbier had not been mistreated and was in fine condition when he was sent back home.</p><p class=\"a-ok-V1\" data-pn=\"4\"/><p class=\"p-block\">\u201cThe U.S. administration, or some people with a certain intention, let him die,\u201d Choe said. \u201cThis must be intended to foster and spread anti-Communist hatred within America.\u201d</p><p class=\"a-ok-V2\" data-pn=\"5\"/><p class=\"p-block\">Officials offered no apology and gave no ground, reflecting a hard line toward the United States that I found everywhere on this visit; Choe derided President Trump as \u201ca crazy man,\u201d \u201ca thug\u201d and \u201ca pathetic man with a big mouth.\u201d I\u2019ve been covering North Korea on and off since the 1980s, and this five-day trip has left me more alarmed than ever about the risks of a catastrophic confrontation.</p><p class=\"p-block\">I was given a visa to North Korea, as were three other New York Times journalists. The U.S. State Department promptly gave us an exemption from the travel ban to North Korea and issued special passports good for a single trip here.</p><p class=\"p-block\">Far more than when I previously visited, North Korea is galvanizing its people to expect a nuclear war with the United States. High school students march in the streets in military uniform every day to denounce America. Posters and billboards along the public roads show missiles destroying the U.S. Capitol and shredding the American flag. In fact, images of missiles are everywhere \u2014 in a kindergarten playground, at a dolphin show, on state television. This military mobilization is accompanied by the ubiquitous assumption that North Korea could not only survive a nuclear conflict, but also win it.</p><p class=\"p-block\">\u201cIf we have to go to war, we won\u2019t hesitate to totally destroy the United States,\u201d explained Mun Hyok-myong, a 38-year-old teacher visiting an amusement park.</p><p class=\"p-block\">Ryang Song-chol, a 41-year-old factory worker, looked surprised when I asked if his country could survive a war with America. \u201cWe would certainly win,\u201d he said.</p><p class=\"a-ok-V1\" data-pn=\"10\"/><p class=\"p-block\">These interviews were conducted in the presence of two Foreign Ministry officials, but even if they weren\u2019t, there is no chance that ordinary people would speak freely to a foreign reporter. This is perhaps the most tightly controlled country in the world, so such quotes should be seen as reflecting a government script \u2014 in this case, a disturbingly jingoistic one.</p><p class=\"a-ok-V2\" data-pn=\"11\"/><p class=\"p-block\">On past trips (my last was in 2005), we journalists stayed at hotels in the capital and were free to walk around on our own, but this time the Foreign Ministry housed us at its own guarded Kobangsan Guest House east of the capital. At first I thought this was simply to restrict us, but increasingly I saw signs of something more interesting and menacing: The Foreign Ministry was also protecting us from hard-liners in the military or in the security services.</p><p class=\"p-block\">\u201cSomeone might hear you are from America,\u201d and there could be trouble, one official explained.</p><p class=\"p-block\">Hard-liners seem to have gained greater power this year, especially after Trump\u2019s threat to \u201ctotally destroy\u201d North Korea, and we were told that military officers sometimes mock their own country\u2019s diplomats for being wimpish \u201cAmerican cronies.\u201d</p><p class=\"p-block\">Foreign Ministry officials escorted us every time we left the compound, probably both to keep us out of mischief and to protect us from the security agencies.</p><p class=\"p-block\">Yes, all this has been a little discomfiting.</p><p class=\"p-block\">The upshot is that I have felt more constraint than on past visits to North Korea, and considerably more tension. Before, I had been able to see senior generals, but this time the military flatly refused to consider my interview requests. The security forces also refused my request to meet the three Americans whom they still detain, one for two years now, without consular access.</p><p class=\"p-block\">A basic problem is that hard-liners seem ascendant in both Washington and Pyongyang.</p><p class=\"p-block\">In Washington, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is advocating a diplomatic resolution to conflict with North Korea \u2014 but Trump undercut him on Twitter last Sunday and said Tillerson was \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/914497877543735296?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Ffortune.com%2F2017%2F10%2F01%2Ftrump-twitter-north-korea-negotiations%2F\">wasting</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/914497877543735296?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Ffortune.com%2F2017%2F10%2F01%2Ftrump-twitter-north-korea-negotiations%2F\">his time</a>.\u201d Trump\u2019s policy toward North Korea is founded on false assumptions that the Supreme Leader, Kim Jong-un, will give up his nuclear weapons, that China can save the day and that military options are real.</p><p class=\"a-ok-V1\" data-pn=\"19\"/><p class=\"p-block\">In Pyongyang, North Korea\u2019s capital, which is full of wide streets and monumental buildings, officials also express little interest in the kind of tough compromises that would be necessary to resolve the crisis.</p><p class=\"a-ok-V2\" data-pn=\"20\"/><p class=\"p-block\">\u201cThe situation on the Korean Peninsula is on the eve of the breakout of nuclear war,\u201d Choe, the Foreign Ministry official, told me. \u201cWe can survive\u201d such a war, he added, and he and other officials said that it was not the right time for talks with the U.S.</p><p class=\"p-block\">The North Koreans insist that the U.S. make the first move and drop its sanctions and \u201chostile attitude\u201d \u2014 which won\u2019t happen. And the U.S. is equally unrealistic in insisting that North Korea give up its entire nuclear program.</p><p class=\"p-block\">I told Choe that my visit gave me a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, reminding me of a trip to Saddam Hussein\u2019s Iraq on the eve of the American invasion. The difference is that a war here would be not just a regional disaster but a nuclear cataclysm.</p><p class=\"p-block\">Choe was unimpressed by my warning. He said that Iraq and Libya had made the mistake of giving up their nuclear programs; in each case, America then ousted the regime. He added that the lesson was obvious, so North Korea will never negotiate away its nuclear warheads.</p><p class=\"p-block\">Still, for all the shadow of possible war, North Korea has had some positive changes. The famine is over (although malnutrition still leaves <a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/DPRK%20Needs%20and%20Priorities%202017.pdf\">one in four children</a> stunted), the economy has developed and government officials are far more open and savvy than a generation ago.</p><p class=\"a-ok-V1\" data-pn=\"25\"/><p class=\"p-block\">Officials used to deny that there was ever any crime in North Korea \u2014 but now they freely concede that this country has thieves, that young women sometimes become pregnant before marriage, that inevitably there\u2019s a measure of corruption. (They do deny that North Korea has any gay people.)</p><p class=\"iframe-holder min300 max300\"><span data-iframe=\"//www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/12/02/opinion/100000003267180.embedded.html\" data-lazy=\"yes\" data-min-width=\"300\"/></p><p class=\"p-block\">North Korea is no longer hermetically sealed, and South Korean pop music and soap operas are smuggled in on flash drives and DVDs from China (watching them is a serious criminal offense). There is also an intranet \u2014 a rigidly controlled domestic version of the internet \u2014 and students learn English from about the third grade. At the best schools, like Pyongyang No. 1 Secondary School, the students are extraordinarily bright and they conversed with us in fluent English, with far more sophistication than on my first visit to the same school in 1989.</p><p class=\"a-ok-V2\" data-pn=\"27\"/><p class=\"p-block\">Yet this is still North Korea. I asked these kids if they had ever heard of Beyonc\u00e9 or the Beatles; none had. I asked if they had heard of Facebook. One had, because computer software sometimes referred to it, but he didn\u2019t know what it was.</p><p class=\"p-block\">Radios or televisions that might get foreign broadcasts are illegal, and there is no access to the internet except for foreigners and senior officials. When I arrived at the airport, my luggage was closely searched for pernicious publications, and even my phone was examined.</p><p class=\"p-block\">\u201cWho\u2019s this person,\u201d the customs official asked suspiciously when she saw an Asian woman appear frequently in my photos.</p><p class=\"p-block\">\u201cMy wife,\u201d I explained.</p><p class=\"p-block\">\u201cOh,\u201d she said, deflated. \u201cShe\u2019s pretty.\u201d</p><p class=\"p-block\">Each home or village has a speaker, a link from Big Brother, that drums in propaganda each morning. Religion and civil society are not allowed. Government controls frayed during the terrible famine of the 1990s, when perhaps 10 percent of the population died, but the controls have returned with the economic recovery. This is the most totalitarian state in the history of the world, because it has computers, closed-circuit cameras, mobile phones and other monitoring technologies that Stalin or Mao could only have dreamed of.</p><p class=\"p-block\">North Korea is also sometimes simply weird. Triplets are taken from their parents and raised by the state because they are considered auspicious. The personality cult is unyielding, with every adult wearing pins of \u201cthe Great Leader,\u201d Kim Il-sung, who died in 1994, or his son, \u201cthe Dear Leader,\u201d Kim Jong-il, who died in 2011, and their portraits are in every home, every factory, every classroom.</p><p class=\"a-ok-V1\" data-pn=\"34\"/><p class=\"p-block\">Every year, people die trying to rescue the Kim portraits from house fires (whether because of genuine loyalty or to win credit with the authorities), and now this Confucian-style reverence is directed to Kim Jong-un, 33, the scion of the dynasty. His name means \u201cjust and merciful,\u201d and the state media are worshipful about his \u201cbrilliant intelligence, military acumen, matchless courage and outstanding art of command,\u201d as one publication put it.</p><p class=\"a-ok-V2\" data-pn=\"35\"/><p class=\"p-block\">Do people really believe this stuff?</p><p class=\"p-block\">I\u2019ve interviewed countless defectors over the years, and they say that there\u2019s more disenchantment among the youth and in the China border area, where Koreans realize that their country has been left behind. But the defectors add that many North Koreans, especially older ones and those distant from the China border, genuinely believe in the system and worship the Kim family \u2014 because they know nothing else.</p><p class=\"p-block\">\u201cMuch of the older generation still remains loyal to the regime,\u201d agreed <a href=\"http://jieunbaek.com/\">Jieun Baek</a>, author of a recent book on how information reaches North Koreans. Attitudes are changing among younger people and those involved in the market economy, she said, but she doesn\u2019t foresee a grass-roots uprising any time soon.</p><p class=\"p-block\">What makes this moment so perilous is that North Koreans are steeped in the idea that they have repeatedly defeated the U.S. \u2014 and can do so again. Every single person we spoke to, from officials to students, voiced certainty that if war breaks out, America will end up in ashes and the Kim regime will emerge victorious.</p><p class=\"p-block\">\u201cU.S. pride will be squished,\u201d predicted Jo Yong-myong, a 20-year-old university student, who thinks war is likely. \u201cThe big nose of the U.S. will be cut off.\u201d</p><p class=\"p-block\">Maybe Kim himself isn\u2019t so recklessly overconfident. But historically, one risk is that dictators come to believe their own propaganda.</p><p class=\"a-ok-V1\" data-pn=\"41\"/><p class=\"p-block\">For a glimpse of the state narrative, I visited the huge new museum in Pyongyang that Kim built for the Korean War. It flatly asserts the standard North Korean line that American imperialists started the war in 1950 by invading the North, rather than (as historians say) that the North started it by sending soldiers into South Korea, and it says that American atrocities in Korea were worse than those of Hitler. \u201cThey killed Korean people for their pleasure,\u201d First Lt. Jang Un-hye, 24, our military guide in the museum, told me as she led me by an exhibit devoted to American use of biological weapons in the war (most historians say this is a fabrication).</p><p class=\"a-ok-V2\" data-pn=\"42\"/><p class=\"p-block\">One hall in the war museum, called \u201cDefeat of the U.S.,\u201d showed a huge diorama with an American soldier\u2019s corpse being picked at by crows, with the sound of their caws filling the room.</p><p class=\"p-block\">Next to the museum is the Pueblo, the American Navy ship seized by North Korea in 1968 \u2014 another victory by the Korean People\u2019s Army over the American imperialists! At the border with South Korea is a museum displaying the ax used to kill two American soldiers there in 1976, also presented as a triumph.</p><p class=\"p-block\">Somehow for all the official hostility, North Koreans tend to be friendly to individual Americans. At the new science and technology tower in Pyongyang, I met a 13-year-old boy, Paek Sin-hyok, who daily participates in military parades at his middle school to mobilize for war. It was his first time meeting Americans, and he said his heart was thumping. I asked about the common North Korean expression that \u201cjust as a wolf cannot become a lamb, so an American imperialist can never change his aggressive nature.\u201d</p><p class=\"p-block\">\u201cWhat about us?\u201d I asked him. \u201cAre we wolves? Or lambs?\u201d</p><p class=\"p-block\">He struggled with how to answer that politely. \u201cHalf and half,\u201d he said.</p><p class=\"p-block\">With this mutual distrust, it\u2019s easy to see how things might go wrong. I suspect North Korea is rational and cares about self-preservation, and I don\u2019t believe that it would fire off a nuclear missile at Guam or Los Angeles just for the thrill. But a dogfight between a North Korean and an American plane could cause a crisis that escalates. Or Trump could order an airstrike on a North Korean missile during fueling on the launchpad \u2014 and that, every North Korean official said, would lead to war.</p><p class=\"a-ok-V1\" data-pn=\"48\"/><p class=\"p-block\">Both sides are on a hair trigger. That\u2019s why in war games, conflicts quickly escalate \u2014 and why the American military estimated back in 1994 that another Korean war would <a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/2017/05/05/what-war-north-korea-looks-588861.html\">cause </a><a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/2017/05/05/what-war-north-korea-looks-588861.html\"> one million casualties</a> and $1 trillion in damage. Today, with the possibility of an exchange of nuclear weapons, the toll could be far greater: <a href=\"http://www.38north.org/2017/10/mzagurek100417/\">One recent study</a> suggested that if North Korea detonated nuclear weapons over Tokyo and Seoul, deaths in those two cities alone could exceed two million.</p><p class=\"a-ok-V2\" data-pn=\"49\"/><p class=\"p-block\">My sense is that both sides are fearful of appearing weak and are trying to intimidate the other with military bluster, but that each would prefer a peaceful resolution \u2014 yet doesn\u2019t know how to get there politically. So how do we get out of this mess?</p><p class=\"p-block\">First, Trump should stop personalizing and escalating the conflict. Second, we need talks without conditions, if only talks about talks: I\u2019d suggest a secret visit to Pyongyang by a senior administration official, as well as discussions with North Korea\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations. Third, human rights have to be part of the agenda, backed by the threat of suspending North Korea\u2019s credentials at the United Nations. Fourth, we should support organizations that smuggle information on USB drives into North Korea; this would be cheap and might contribute to change in the long term. Fifth, increase cyberwarfare, which the U.S. has already used effectively against North Korea. Sixth, let\u2019s enforce tighter sanctions, but only if harnessed to a plausible outcome.</p><p class=\"p-block\">Ultimately, the best hope that is realistic may be a variant of what\u2019s called a \u201cfreeze for a freeze,\u201d with North Korea halting its nuclear and missile tests in exchange for a reduction in sanctions and in U.S.-South Korean military exercises \u2014 as an interim step, preserving the long-term goal of denuclearization. Unfortunately, both sides resist this approach; I was disappointed in the lack of North Korean interest.</p><p class=\"p-block\">So if we can\u2019t work out a freeze for a freeze, realistically the next best option is to settle into long-term mutual deterrence. But that would be risky, not least because we have an American president and a North Korean leader who both seem impetuous, overconfident and temperamentally inclined to escalate any dispute \u2014 and the American mainland increasingly will be in the cross hairs of North Korean nuclear warheads.</p><p class=\"p-block\">I leave North Korea with the same sense of foreboding that I felt after leaving Saddam\u2019s Iraq in 2002. War is preventable, but I\u2019m not sure it will be prevented.</p></div></div></body></html>"}, "15429594": {"score": 4, "comments": [], "time": "2017-10-08 22:36:03", "url": "https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/09/guide-common-types-two-factor-authentication-web", "text": "<html><body><div><div class=\"field__item even\"><p><a href=\"https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/how-enable-two-factor-authentication\">Two-factor authentication</a> (or 2FA) is one of the biggest-bang-for-your-buck ways to improve the security of your online accounts.

With often just a few clicks in a given account's settings, 2FA adds an extra layer of security to your online accounts on top of your password.</p>\n<p>In addition to requesting something you <i>know</i> to log in (in this case, your password), an account protected with 2FA will also request information from something you <i>have (</i>usually your phone or a special USB security key). Once you put in your password, you'll grab a code from a text or app on your phone or plug in your security key before you are allowed to log in. Some platforms call 2FA different things\u2014Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), Two Step Verification (2SV), or Login Approvals\u2014but no matter the name, the idea is the same: Even if someone gets your password, they won't be able to access your accounts unless they also have your phone or security key.</p>\n<p>There are four main types of 2FA <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/12/12-days-2fa-how-enable-two-factor-authentication-your-online-accounts\">in common use by consumer websites</a>, and it's useful to know the differences. Some sites offer only one option; other sites offer a few different options. We recommend checking <a href=\"https://twofactorauth.org/\">twofactorauth.org</a> to find out which sites support 2FA and how, and turning on 2FA for as many of your online accounts as possible. For more visual learners, this <a href=\"https://www.accessnow.org/cms/assets/uploads/2017/09/Choose-the-Best-MFA-for-you.png\">infographic</a> from Access Now\u00a0offers <a href=\"https://www.accessnow.org/decoding-two-factor-authentication-solution-right/\">additional information</a>.</p>\n<p>Finally, the extra layer of protection from 2FA doesn't mean you should use a weak password. Always make <a href=\"https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/creating-strong-passwords%20\">unique, strong passwords</a> for each of your accounts, and then put 2FA on top of those for even better log-in security.</p>\n<h3>SMS 2FA</h3>\n<p/>\n<p>When you enable a site's SMS 2FA option, you'll often be asked to provide a phone number. Next time you log in with your username and password, you'll also be asked to enter a short code (typically 5-6 digits) that gets texted to your phone. This is a very popular option for sites to implement, since many people have an SMS-capable phone number and it doesn't require installing an app. It provides a significant step up in account security relative to just a username and password.</p>\n<p>There are some disadvantages, however. Some people may not be comfortable giving their phone number\u2014a piece of potentially identifying information\u2014to a given website or platform. Even worse, some websites, once they have your phone number for 2FA purposes, will use it for other purposes, like targeted advertising, conversion tracking, and password resets. Allowing password resets based on a phone number provided for 2FA is an especially egregious problem, because it means attackers using phone number takeovers could <a href=\"https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/07/10/att_falls_for_hacker_tricks/\">get access to your account</a> <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-four-critical-security-flaws-that-resulte/\">without even knowing your password</a>.</p>\n<p>Further, you can't log in with SMS 2FA if your phone is dead or can't connect to a mobile network. This can especially be a problem when travelling abroad. Also, it's often possible for an attacker to trick your phone company into assigning your phone number to a different SIM card, allowing them to receive your 2FA codes. <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2017/05/fix-ss7-two-factor-authentication-bank-accounts/\">Flaws in the SS7 telephony protocol</a> can allow the same thing. Note that both of these attacks only reduce the security of your account to the security of your <a href=\"https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/creating-strong-passwords#multi-factorauthenticationandone-timepasswords\">password</a>.</p>\n<h3>Authenticator App / TOTP 2FA</h3>\n<p/>\n<p class=\"ace-line\">Another phone-based option for 2FA is to use an application that generates codes locally based on a secret key. Google Authenticator is a very popular application for this; FreeOTP is a free software alternative. The underlying technology for this style of 2FA is called Time-Based One Time Password (TOTP), and is part of the Open Authentication (OATH) architecture (not to be confused with OAuth, the technology behind \"Log in with Facebook\" and \"Log in with Twitter\" buttons).</p>\n<p class=\"ace-line\">If a site offers this style of 2FA, it will show you a QR code containing the secret key. You can scan that QR code into your application. If you have multiple phones you can scan it multiple times; you can also save the image to a safe place or print it out if you need a backup. Once you've scanned such a QR code, your application will produce a new 6-digit code every 30 seconds. Similar to SMS 2FA, you'll have to enter one of these codes in addition to your username and password in order to log in.</p>\n<p>This style of 2FA improves on SMS 2FA because you can use it even when your phone is not connected to a mobile network, and because the secret key is stored physically on your phone. If someone redirects your phone number to their own phone, they still won't be able to get your 2FA codes. It also has some disadvantages: If your phone dies or gets stolen, and you don't have printed backup codes or a saved copy of the original QR code, you can lose access to your account. For this reason, many sites will encourage you to enable SMS 2FA as a backup. Also, if you log in frequently on different computers, it can be inconvenient to unlock your phone, open an app, and type in the code each time.</p>\n<h3>Push-based 2FA</h3>\n<p>Some systems, like Duo Push and Apple's Trusted Devices method, can send a prompt to one of your devices during login. This prompt will indicate that someone (possibly you) is trying to log in, and an estimated location for the login attempt. You can then approve or deny the attempt.</p>\n<p>This style of 2FA improves on authenticator apps in two ways: Acknowledging the prompt is slightly more convenient than typing in a code, and it is somewhat more resistant to phishing. With SMS and authenticator apps, a phishing site can simply ask for your code in addition to your password, and pass that code along to the legitimate site when logging in as you. Because push-based 2FA generally displays an estimated location based on the IP address from which a login was originated, and most phishing attacks don't happen to be operated from the same IP address ranges as their victims, you may be able to spot a phishing attack in progress by noticing that the estimated location differs from your actual location. However, this requires that you pay close attention to a subtle security indicator. And since location is only estimated, it's tempting to ignore any anomalies. So the additional phishing protection provided by push-based 2FA is limited.</p>\n<p>Disadvantages of push-based 2FA: It's not standardized, so you can't choose from a variety of authenticator apps, and can't consolidate all your push-based credentials in a single app. Also, it requires a working data connection on your phone, while Authenticator apps don't require any connection, and SMS can work on an SMS-only phone plane (or in poor signal areas).</p>\n<h3>FIDO U2F / Security Keys</h3>\n<p/>\n<p>Universal Second Factor (U2F) is a relatively new style of 2FA, typically using small USB, NFC or Bluetooth Low Energy (BTLE) devices often called \"security keys.\" To set it up on a site, you register your U2F device. On subsequent logins, the site will prompt you to connect your device and tap it to allow the login.</p>\n<p>Like push-based 2FA, this means you don't have to type any codes. Under the hood, the U2F device recognizes the site you are on and responds with a code (a signed challenge) that is specific to that site. This means that U2F has a very important advantage over the other 2FA methods: It is actually phishing-proof, because the browser includes the site name when talking to the U2F device, and the U2F device won't respond to sites it hasn't been registered to. U2F is also well-designed from a privacy perspective: You can use the same U2F device on multiple sites, but you have a different identity with each site, so they can't use a single unique device identity for tracking.</p>\n<p>The main downsides of U2F are browser support, mobile support, and cost. Right now only Chrome supports U2F, though Firefox is working on an <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/CryptoEngineering#Web_Authentication\">implementation</a>. The W3C is working on further <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/\">standardizing the U2F protocol for the web</a>, which should lead to further adoption. Additionally, mobile support is challenging, because most U2F devices use USB.</p>\n<p>There are a handful of U2F devices that work with mobile phones over NFC and BTLE. NFC is supported only on Android. On iOS, Apple does not currently allow apps to interact with the NFC hardware, which prevents effective use of NFC U2F. BTLE is much less desirable because a BTLE U2F device requires a battery, and the pairing experience is less intuitive that tapping an NFC device. However, poor mobile support doesn't mean that using U2F prevents you from logging in on mobile. Most sites that support U2F also support TOTP and backup codes. You can log in once on your mobile device using one of those options, while using your phishing-proof U2F device for logins on the desktop. This is particularly effective for mobile sites and apps that only require you to log in once, and keep you logged in.</p>\n<p>Lastly, most other 2FA methods are free, assuming you already have a smartphone. Most U2F devices cost money. Brad Hill has put together <a href=\"https://github.com/hillbrad/U2FReviews/blob/master/README.md\">a review of various U2F devices</a>, which generally cost USD $10-$20. GitHub has written<a href=\"https://github.com/github/SoftU2F\"> a free, software-based U2F authenticator for macOS</a>, but using this as your only U2F device would mean that losing your laptop could result in losing access to your account.</p>\n<h3>Bonus: Backup Codes</h3>\n<p/>\n<p>Sites will often give you a set of ten backup codes to print out and use in case your phone is dead or you lose your security key. Hard-copy backup codes are also useful when traveling, or in other situations where your phone may not have signal or reliable charging. No matter which 2FA method you decide is right for you, it's a good idea to keep these backup codes in a safe place to make sure you don't get locked out of your account when you need them.</p>\n\n</div></div></body></html>"}, "15429083": {"score": 1, "comments": [], "time": "2017-10-08 20:32:55", "url": "http://dominoqq81.com/download-aplikasi-99-online-bandar-ceme/", "text": "<html><body><div><div class=\"post_content entry-content\">\n\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t                        \t\t\t\t\t<h2><strong>Download Aplikasi 99 Online Bandar Ceme\u00a0</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Download aplikasi 99 online bandar ceme</strong> judi online melalui browser smartphone mu dengan mudah dan sekarang juga, dapatkan sebuah permainan ceme yang berkualitas tanpa adanya gangguan koneksi yang lambat ataupun koneksi data server yang dimiliki oleh sebuah situs judi online yang dapat menggangu jalannya permainan anda.

For example, making a mistake on an\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array\">FPGA</a> usually\nonly costs your time to fix it, whereas a mistake within an\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-specific_integrated_circuit\">ASIC</a>\ndesign may cost you many millions of dollars.</p>\n\n<p>For all these reasons, if your goal is speed, you may find yourself\nconsidering an\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array\">FPGA</a>\nas your solution.  They are hands down the most economical means of running\nan algorithm faster than a \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit\">CPU</a> can.</p>\n\n<p>Just don\u2019t neglect the speed of your interface while you consider engineering an\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array\">FPGA</a>\nsolution.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"its-the-interfaces-sir\">It\u2019s the interfaces, Sir</h2>\n\n<p>I\u2019ve noticed, as I\u2019ve personally worked with\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array\">FPGA</a>\u2019s, that the\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array\">FPGA</a>\nfabric has rarely ever limited my algorithm\u2019s speed and performance needs.\nThat\u2019s always been the easy part of the task.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to calculate a\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haar_wavelet\">Haar wavelet</a>\ntransform on an image?\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array\">FPGA</a>\u2019s have\nenough logic to run the algorithm many times over within them!  You can run\nthe transform horizontally, vertically, no problem\u2013the raw task is easy for an\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array\">FPGA</a>.</p>\n\n<p>That\u2019s not the hard part.</p>\n\n<p>The hard part is feeding the algorithm with data, and getting the results back\nout fast enough to be competitive with the alternatives.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps an example will help explain what I\u2019m talking about.</p>\n\n<p>Years ago, I had the opportunity to work on a really neat\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System\">GPS</a>\nprocessing algorithm.  If you are familiar with\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System\">GPS</a> processing,\nyou\u2019ll know that the success of a\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System\">GPS</a>\nprocessing algorithm is based upon how many correlations you can do and how\nfast you can do them.</p>\n\n<p>In my case, I was starting with a special algorithm that had been demonstrated\nin software, and had proven itself in software on a general purpose\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit\">CPU</a>.  My problem\nwas that the algorithm ran slower than pond water.  My team needed speed.\nFor other reasons, there was an\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array\">FPGA</a>\nconnected to to our\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit\">CPU</a>\nmicrocontroller.  So we asked ourselves, why not use the\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array\">FPGA</a>\nto speed up the processing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Specifically, I was interfacing an\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture\">ARM</a>\nbased PXA271 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XScale\">XScale</a>\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit\">CPU</a>, built by\n<a href=\"https://www.intel.com\">Intel</a> at the time, with a Spartan 3\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array\">FPGA</a>,\nfrom <a href=\"https://www.xilinx.com\">Xilinx</a>.  The\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System\">GPS</a>\nalgorithms performance was dominated by the number\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform\">FFT</a>\u2019s\nthe <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit\">CPU</a>\nhad to accomplish.  Why not do those\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform\">FFT</a>\u2019s\nwithin the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array\">FPGA</a>,\nand run them that much faster?</p>\n\n<p>If you look at\n<a href=\"https://www.xilinx.com\">Xilinx</a>\u2019s\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform\">FFT</a>\nIP core, they offer a pipelined\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform\">FFT</a>\ncore that can run one\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform\">FFT</a>\nsample per clock\u2013just like they did when I was working on this\nproblem.  Hence, an N point\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform\">FFT</a>\ncosts N clocks to ingest into the\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform\">FFT</a>,\nand after some (short) processing delay it takes N clocks to get the data\nback out.  How much faster could you get?  The\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture\">ARM</a>\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit\">CPU</a>\ntook many more clocks than that to process the\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform\">FFT</a>, so this should\nbe much faster, right?</p>\n\n<p>So I built it.</p>\n\n<p>The\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture\">ARM</a>\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit\">CPU</a>\nand the\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array\">FPGA</a>\nwere both attached on the same physical bus.  That meant I could have the\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit\">CPU</a>\nsend the\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array\">FPGA</a> the\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform\">FFT</a>\ndata over the bus and then read it back when finished.</p>\n\n<p>With a little bit of debugging, I managed to get it all to work.  It wasn\u2019t\nall that hard technically to build, and speed was very important to\nour application.  So, we ran the algorithm with a stop watch, anxiously\nwaiting to see how much faster it would run.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Much to my displeasure, the new\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array\">FPGA</a>\nenhanced\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform\">FFT</a>\nalgorithm <em>didn\u2019t run any faster</em>.  Indeed, as I recall, I think it even ran\nslower.  I was shocked.  This wasn\u2019t what I was expecting.</p>\n\n<p>That\u2019s when I learned the painful lesson that an algorithm\u2019s speed is dependent\nupon the interface speed that feeds the algorithm.  In our case, the interface\nwas so slow that just transferring the data to the\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array\">FPGA</a>\nand reading the results back took more time to do than to perform the\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform\">FFT</a>\nin the first place.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"learn-the-interfaces\">Learn the interfaces!</h2>\n\n<p>This is one of the reasons why the study of\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array\">FPGA</a>\ndesign needs to include a study of interfaces and how to interact with them.\nIndeed, if you look at one of my favorite\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array\">FPGA</a>\nwebsites, <a href=\"http://fpga4fun.com\">fpga4fun.com</a>,\nyou\u2019ll find a lot of discussions about how to build interfaces.\nThey discuss <a href=\"http://fpga4fun.com/SerialInterface.html\">serial ports</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.fpga4fun.com/I2C.html\">I2C</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.fpga4fun.com/SPI.html\">SPI</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.fpga4fun.com/JTAG.html\">JTAG</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.fpga4fun.com/PongGame.html\">simple video ports (play Pong!)</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.fpga4fun.com/HDMI.html\">HDMI</a>,\nand more.  All of these interfaces have their purpose, and the\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array\">FPGA</a>\nstudent is well served by studying how to interact with them.</p>\n\n<p>Sadly, none of them would\u2019ve been fast enough to rescue my\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform\">FFT</a>\nprocessing needs above.  (Although, \u2026 using the\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_memory_access\">DMA</a>\ncontroller on the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XScale\">XScale</a>\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit\">CPU</a>\nmight\u2019ve helped \u2026)</p>\n\n<p>So, for this reason, let me recommend to you that before you spend your whole\ndime on making your\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array\">FPGA</a> run\nsuper fast with multiple copies of your algorithm all running in parallel,\nthat you at least spend as much (or more) of that dime guaranteeing that the\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array\">FPGA</a>\ncan read and write your data fast enough to keep your\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array\">FPGA</a>\nbusy running that super-algorithm.</p>\n\n\n  </div>\n\n\n</div></body></html>"}, "15429260": {"score": 24, "comments": ["I think a real takeaway from this article is that long distance space travel will not be truly realistic until we have a way to simulate earth\u2019s gravity on a ship.

As part of NASA's planned journey to Mars, we're members of a program designed to discover what effect such long-term time in space has on human beings. This was my fourth trip to space, and by the end of the mission I'd spent 520 days up there, more than any other NASA astronaut. Amiko has gone through the whole process with me as my main support once before, when I spent 159 days on the ISS in 2010-11.

Find the edge of the bed. Feet down. Sit up. Stand up. At every stage I\u00a0feel like I'm fighting through quicksand. When I'm finally vertical, the pain in my legs is awful, and on top of that pain I feel a sensation that's even more alarming: it feels as though all the blood in my body is rushing to my legs, like the sensation of the blood rushing to your head when you do a handstand, but in reverse.</p><p>I can feel the tissue in my legs swelling. I shuffle my way to the bath room, moving my weight from one foot to the other with deliberate effort. Left. Right. Left. Right. I make it to the bathroom, flip on the light, and look down at my legs. They are swollen and alien stumps, not legs at all. \"Oh shit,\" I say. \"Amiko, come look at this.\" She kneels down and squeezes one ankle, and it squishes like a water balloon. She looks up at me with worried eyes. \"I can't even feel your ankle bones,\" she says.</p><p>\"My skin is burning, too,\" I tell her. Amiko frantically examines me. I have a strange rash all over my back, the backs of my legs, the back of my head and neck \u2013 everywhere I was in contact with the bed. I can feel her cool hands moving over my inflamed skin. \"It looks like an allergic rash,\" she says. \"Like hives.\"</p><p>I use the bathroom and shuffle back to bed, wondering what I should do. Normally if I woke up feeling like this, I would go to the emergency room. But no one at the hospital will have seen symptoms of having been in space for a year. I crawl back into bed, trying to find a way to lie down without touching my rash.</p><p>I can hear Amiko rummaging in the medicine cabinet. She returns with two ibuprofen and a glass of water. As she settles down, I can tell from her every movement, every breath, that she is worried about me. We both knew the risks of the mission I signed on for. After six years together, I can understand her perfectly, even in the wordless dark.</p><p>As I try to will myself to sleep, I wonder whether my friend Misha, by now back in Moscow, is also suffering from swollen legs and painful rashes. I suspect so. This is why we volunteered for this mission, after all: to discover more about how the human body is affected by long-term space flight. Scientists will study the data on Misha and my 53-year-old self for the rest of our lives and beyond. Our space agencies won't be able to push out farther into space, to a destination like Mars, until we can learn more about how to strengthen the weakest links in the chain that make space flight possible: the human body and mind.</p><p>People often ask me why I volunteered for this mission, knowing the risks: the risk of launch, the risk inherent in space walks, the risk of returning to Earth, the risks I would be exposed to every moment I lived in a metal container orbiting the Earth at 28,100 kilometres an hour. I have a few answers I give to this question, but none of them feels fully satisfying to me. None of them quite answers it.</p><div> \n <div class=\"cT-imageLandscape lead\">\n  <img alt=\"Scott Kelly (at left) undertaking a dangerous space walk outside the International Space Station\" src=\"http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/g/y/u/7/a/y/image.imgtype.articleLeadwide.620x0.png/1507092076777.png\" title=\"\"/> \n  <p>Scott Kelly (at left) undertaking a dangerous space walk outside the International Space Station.<cite><i> Photo: Courtesy of Penguin Random House Australia</i></cite></p>\n </div> \n</div><p><strong>A normal mission\u00a0to the International Space Station</strong> lasts five to six months, so scientists have a good deal of data about what happens to the human body in space for that length of time. But very little is known about what occurs after month six. The symptoms may get precipitously worse in the ninth month, for instance, or they may level off. We don't know, and there is only one way to find out.</p><p>During our mission, Misha and I collected various types of data for studies on our selves, which took a significant amount of our time. Because Mark and I were identical twins, I also took part in an extensive study comparing the two of us throughout the year, down to the genetic level. The ISS was a world-class orbiting laboratory, and in addition to the human studies of which I was one of the main subjects, I also spent a lot of my time during the year working on other experiments, like fluid physics, botany, combustion and Earth observation.</p><p>When I talked about the ISS to audiences, I always shared with them the importance of the science being done there. But to me, it was just as important that the station was serving as a foothold for our species in space. From here, we could learn more about how to push out further into the cosmos. The costs were high, as were the risks.</p><p>On my previous flight\u00a0to the space station, a mission of 159 days, I lost bone mass, my muscles atrophied, and my blood redistributed itself in my body, which strained and shrank the walls of my heart. More troubling, I experienced problems with my vision, as many other astronauts had. I had been exposed to more than 30 times the radiation of a person on Earth, equivalent to about 10 chest X-rays every day. This exposure would increase my risk of a fatal cancer for the rest of my life.</p><p>None of this compared, though, to the most troubling risk: that something bad could happen to someone I love while I was in space with no way for me to come home.</p><p><strong>I had\u00a0been on the station for a week</strong>, and was getting better at knowing where I was when I first woke up. If I had a headache, I knew it was because I had drifted too far from the vent blowing clean air at my face. I was often still disoriented about how my body was positioned: I would wake up convinced that I was upside down, because in the dark and without gravity, my inner ear took a random guess as to how my body was positioned in the small space. When I turned on a light, I had a sort of visual illusion that the room was rotating rapidly as it reoriented itself around me, though I knew it was actually my brain readjusting in response to new sensory input.</p><p>The light in my crew quarters took a minute to warm up to full brightness. The space was just barely big enough for me and my sleeping bag, two laptops, some clothes, toiletries, photos of Amiko and my daughters, a few paperback books. I looked at my schedule for today. I clicked through new emails, stretched and yawned, then fished around in my toiletries bag, attached to the wall down by my left knee, for my toothpaste and toothbrush. I brushed, still in my sleeping bag, then swallowed the toothpaste and chased it with a sip of water out of a bag with a straw. There wasn't really a good way to spit in space.</p><p><strong>I didn't\u00a0get to spend time outside the station</strong> until my first of two planned space walks, which was almost seven months in. This was one of the things that some people found difficult to imagine about living on the space station, the fact that I couldn't step outside when I felt like it. Putting on a spacesuit and leaving the station for a space walk was an hours-long process that required the full attention of at least three people on station and dozens more on the ground.</p><p>Space walks were the most dangerous thing we did in orbit. Even if the station was on fire, even if it was filling up with poison gas, even if a meteoroid had crashed through a module and outer space was rushing in, the only way to escape the station was in a Soyuz capsule, which also needed preparation and planning to depart safely. We practised dealing with emergency scenarios regularly, and in many of these drills we raced to prepare the Soyuz as quickly as we could. No one had ever had to use the Soyuz as a lifeboat, and no one hoped to.</p><p><strong>I opened\u00a0a food container</strong> attached to the wall and fished out a pouch of dehydrated coffee with cream and sugar. I floated over to the hot-water dispenser in the ceiling of the lab, which worked by insert ing a needle into a nozzle on the bag. When the bag was full, I replaced the needle with a drinking straw \u2013 this way the liquid didn't escape into the module. It had been oddly unsatisfying at first to drink coffee from a plastic bag sipped through a straw, but now I wasn't bothered by it.</p><p>I flipped through the breakfast options, looking for a packet of the granola I liked. Unfortunately, everyone else seemed to like it, too. I chose some dehydrated eggs instead and reconstituted them with the same hot water dispenser, then warmed up some irradiated sausage links in the food warmer box, which looked a lot like a metal briefcase. I cut the bag open, then, since we had no sink, cleaned the scissors by licking them (we each had our own scissors). I spooned the eggs out of the bag onto a tortilla \u2013 conveniently, surface tension held them in place \u2013 added the sausage and some hot sauce, rolled it up, and ate the burrito while catch ing up with the morning's news on <em>CNN</em>.</p><p>All the while I was holding myself in place with my right big toe tucked ever so slightly under a handrail on the floor. Handrails were placed on the walls, floors and ceilings of every module and at the hatches where modules connected, allowing us to propel ourselves through the modules or to stay in place rather than drifting away. There were a lot of things about living in weightlessness that were fun, but eating was not one of them. I missed being able to sit in a chair while eating a meal, relaxing and pausing to connect with other people.</p><div> \n <div class=\"cT-imageLandscape lead\">\n  <img alt=\"I missed being able to sit in a chair while eating a meal. \" src=\"http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/g/y/u/7/b/a/image.imgtype.articleLeadwide.620x0.png/1507092086244.png\" title=\"\"/> \n  <p>\"I missed being able to sit in a chair while eating a meal, relaxing and pausing to connect with other people,\" writes Kelly of life on the ISS. <cite><i> Photo: Marco Grob</i></cite></p>\n </div> \n</div><p><strong>More than 400 experiments </strong>took place on ISS during this expedition. NASA scientists talked about the research falling into two major categories. The first had to do with studies that might benefit life on Earth. These included research on the properties of chemicals that could be used in new drugs, combustion studies that were unlocking new ways to get more efficiency out of the fuel we burnt, and the development of new materials. The second large category had to do with solving problems for future space exploration: testing new life-support equipment, solving technical problems of spaceflight and studying new ways of handling the demands of the human body in space.</p><p>Science took up about a third of my time, human studies about three-quarters of that. I had to take blood samples from myself and my crew mates for analysis back on Earth, and I kept a log of everything, from what I ate to my moods. I tested my reaction skills at various points throughout the day. I took ultrasounds of blood vessels, my heart, my eyes and my muscles. I also took part in an experiment called Fluid Shifts, using a device that sucked the blood down to the lower half of my body, where gravity normally kept it. This tested a leading theory about why space flight caused damage to some astronauts' vision.</p><p>In fact, there was much crossover between these categories of research. If we could learn how to counteract the devastating impact of bone loss in microgravity, the solutions could well be applied to osteoporosis and other bone diseases. If we could learn how to keep our hearts healthy in space, that knowledge could be useful on Earth.\u00a0</p><p>The effects of living in space looked a lot like the effects of ageing, which affected us all. The\u00a0lettuce we grew was a study for future space travel \u2013 astronauts on their way to Mars will have no fresh food but what they can grow \u2013 but it also taught us more about growing food efficiently on Earth. The ISS's closed water system, where we processed our urine into clean water, will be crucial for getting to Mars, but it also has promising implications for treating water on Earth \u2013 especially in places where clean water was scarce.</p><p><strong>I tell\u00a0my flight surgeon, Steve,</strong> that I feel well enough to get right to work immediately upon returning from space, and I do, but within a few days I feel much worse. This is what it means to have allowed my body to be used for science. I will be a test subject for the rest of my life. A few months after arriving back on\u00a0Earth, though, I feel distinctly better. I've been travelling the country and the world talking about my experiences in space. It's gratifying to see how curious people are about my mission, how much children instinctively feel the excitement and wonder of space flight, and how many people think, as I do, that Mars is the next step.</p><p>I also know that if we want to go to Mars, it will be very, very difficult, it will cost a great deal of money and it may likely cost human lives. But I know now that if we decide to do it, we can.\u00a0</p><p><strong>Edited extract from <em>Endurance: A Year in Space, A Lifetime of Discovery</em> by Scott Kelly (Doubleday, $35), published on October 19.</strong></p></div>\n</div></body></html>"}, "15429603": {"score": 1, "comments": [], "time": "2017-10-08 22:39:10", "url": "https://bitsandscrews.com/aols-instant-messenger-service-aim-will-go-permanently-offline-in-december-after-20-years", "text": "<html><body><div><body id=\"readabilityBody\"><p>Error detected by Application Firewall.

However, the .NET regular expression engine\n  provides a few constructs that allow balanced constructs to be\n  recognized. </p>\n  \n  <ul>\n  <li><code>(?&lt;group&gt;)</code> - pushes the captured result on the capture stack with\n  the name group.</li>\n  <li><code>(?&lt;-group&gt;)</code> - pops the top most capture with the name group off the\n  capture stack.</li>\n  <li><code>(?(group)yes|no)</code> - matches the yes part if there exists a group\n  with the name group otherwise matches no part.</li>\n  </ul>\n  \n  <p>These constructs allow for a .NET regular expression to emulate a\n  restricted PDA by essentially allowing simple versions of the stack\n  operations: push, pop and empty. The simple operations are pretty much\n  equivalent to increment, decrement and compare to zero respectively.\n  This allows for the .NET regular expression engine to recognize a\n  subset of the context-free languages, in particular the ones that only\n  require a simple counter. This in turn allows for the non-traditional\n  .NET regular expressions to recognize individual properly balanced\n  constructs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Consider the following regular expression:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-none prettyprint-override\"><code>(?=&lt;ul\\s+id=\"matchMe\"\\s+type=\"square\"\\s*&gt;)\n(?&gt;\n   &lt;!-- .*? --&gt;                  |\n   &lt;[^&gt;]*/&gt;                      |\n   (?&lt;opentag&gt;&lt;(?!/)[^&gt;]*[^/]&gt;)  |\n   (?&lt;-opentag&gt;&lt;/[^&gt;]*[^/]&gt;)     |\n   [^&lt;&gt;]*\n)*\n(?(opentag)(?!))\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Use the flags:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Singleline</li>\n<li>IgnorePatternWhitespace (not necessary if you collapse regex and remove all whitespace)</li>\n<li>IgnoreCase (not necessary)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Regular Expression Explained (inline)</h2>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-none prettyprint-override\"><code>(?=&lt;ul\\s+id=\"matchMe\"\\s+type=\"square\"\\s*&gt;) # match start with &lt;ul id=\"matchMe\"...\n(?&gt;                                        # atomic group / don't backtrack (faster)\n   &lt;!-- .*? --&gt;                 |          # match xml / html comment\n   &lt;[^&gt;]*/&gt;                     |          # self closing tag\n   (?&lt;opentag&gt;&lt;(?!/)[^&gt;]*[^/]&gt;) |          # push opening xml tag\n   (?&lt;-opentag&gt;&lt;/[^&gt;]*[^/]&gt;)    |          # pop closing xml tag\n   [^&lt;&gt;]*                                  # something between tags\n)*                                         # match as many xml tags as possible\n(?(opentag)(?!))                           # ensure no 'opentag' groups are on stack\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You can try this at <a href=\"http://derekslager.com/blog/posts/2007/09/a-better-dotnet-regular-expression-tester.ashx\" rel=\"noreferrer\">A Better .NET Regular Expression Tester</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I used the sample source of:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n   &lt;br /&gt;\n   &lt;ul id=\"matchMe\" type=\"square\"&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;stuff...&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;more stuff&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;\n          &lt;div&gt;\n               &lt;span&gt;still more&lt;/span&gt;\n               &lt;ul&gt;\n                    &lt;li&gt;Another &amp;gt;ul&amp;lt;, oh my!&lt;/li&gt;\n                    &lt;li&gt;...&lt;/li&gt;\n               &lt;/ul&gt;\n          &lt;/div&gt;\n      &lt;/li&gt;\n   &lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This found the match:</p>\n\n<pre><code>   &lt;ul id=\"matchMe\" type=\"square\"&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;stuff...&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;more stuff&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;\n          &lt;div&gt;\n               &lt;span&gt;still more&lt;/span&gt;\n               &lt;ul&gt;\n                    &lt;li&gt;Another &amp;gt;ul&amp;lt;, oh my!&lt;/li&gt;\n                    &lt;li&gt;...&lt;/li&gt;\n               &lt;/ul&gt;\n          &lt;/div&gt;\n      &lt;/li&gt;\n   &lt;/ul&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>although it actually came out like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;ul id=\"matchMe\" type=\"square\"&gt;           &lt;li&gt;stuff...&lt;/li&gt;           &lt;li&gt;more stuff&lt;/li&gt;           &lt;li&gt;               &lt;div&gt;                    &lt;span&gt;still more&lt;/span&gt;                    &lt;ul&gt;                         &lt;li&gt;Another &amp;gt;ul&amp;lt;, oh my!&lt;/li&gt;                         &lt;li&gt;...&lt;/li&gt;                    &lt;/ul&gt;               &lt;/div&gt;           &lt;/li&gt;        &lt;/ul&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Lastly, I really enjoyed Jeff Atwood's article:  <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2009/11/parsing-html-the-cthulhu-way.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Parsing Html The Cthulhu Way</a>.

The company hasn\u2019t fixed the name of the product. However, we can confirm that <strong>the new camera will provide support for EIS and Gyroscope</strong>.</p><p>The purpose of EIS is to enhance the quality of the images by minimizing blurring. Moreover, you will be able to capture excellent quality images even if you shake your device during snapping of images. Technically, the EIS will not be able to prevent blue as a result of extreme shaking. However, the technology can minimize blue to a large extent with normal shaking.</p><p>This new camera will be small in size but <strong>MGCOOL has added support for EIS and Gyroscope</strong>, which are not available with competing cameras. You will be unable to notice any blur. Moreover, <a href=\"https://www.gismotrends.com/mgcool-explorer-3/\">MGCOOL Explorer 3</a> has additional features to enable the camera to snap bright and crisp images even if you shake the camera little bit aggressively.</p><p>It is said that <strong>MGCOOL has adopted a new video coding standard</strong> that specifies how to decode video, which is the successor to <em>Advanced Video Coding</em> (AVC), also known as H.264. The captured video will be automatically encoded to meet the relevant compatible formats. And a video file encoded with this new coding standard can occupy half the storage space of its H.264 equivalent with no noticeable change in quality.</p><p>Obviously, MGCOOL is working hard to infuse latest trending technologies to stay one step ahead of the competition. We will continue to expose new features expected to be included with our upcoming camera.</p><p>Stay tuned to MGCOOL social channels for updates.</p><p>// <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Mgcool.fans/\">Facebook</a></p></div></div></body></html>"}, "15429616": {"score": 181, "comments": ["The truth is that the construction of CRUD web UIs _is_ 90% automated.<p>The web and storage frameworks do the vast majority of the heavy lifting - the application code is really just simple wiring and validation.<p>The trouble is that (in my experience, at least) many web shops and web developers enormously overcomplicate that application code; shoehorning enterprise &quot;layering&quot; into simple components, creating poor - and often unnecessary - abstraction.

It&#x27;s a mistake for the UI or anything that is aware of the UI library to try to model these domain invariants.  Instead a call should go the model layer which then returns (or throws) an error providing enough info for the UI to gracefully help the user.<p>The UI framework can play an important role in this: but that role is to help programmers provide a UI for the validator that lives in a model layer.  It is not to do the validation itself.  (Although frameworks should provoide an arsenal of simple, single field validators, of the  &quot;this field has data-type phone-number&quot; kind).", "Sure, I don&#x27;t disagree.<p>But for the current state of CRUD application frameworks that do not do this, it implies some enforcement at the data layer and probably some hint at this at the ORM level. This really does not exist in any sufficient way.<p>It reminds me of the idea that a graph&#x2F;diagram generator that used some generic data source could be a common analytics tool, and that with a few well-defined defaults no-one would need to run lots of different analytics tools, or they could be generated automatically and would be good enough.<p>In reality they never are good enough. There is no one-size-fits-all analytics system because the KPIs differ from company to company, project to project, and these differences go all the way down.<p>Sometimes we see something being sold as a &quot;this is all you need&quot;, i.e. a SAP solution or some generic tooling, even Stripe, etc. But the level of customisation typically required to make it sufficient for a mature organisation to use it is typically quite high.<p>A strategy to resolve this usually is: Change the org to fit the tech, rather than the tech to fit the org. But I&#x27;ve seen this fail consistently as typically the tech is too simplistic.<p>Then there&#x27;s the &quot;customise it to fit your needs&quot;, but going back to custom multi-field validation, or analytics... the number of permutations of logic is immense and the customisation tools themselves only allow simple expression of that customisation.<p>The end conclusion is that we need extreme levels of customisation, but when provided through tooling the effort to perform and manage the customisation (with auditing of who changed what, when, etc) is such that actually it is simpler and cheaper to write the customisation in code.", "The reason for that is because we tend to &quot;stop thinking after automating CRUD&quot;. I think CRUD is only the basic tools on top of which &quot;Actions&quot; and &quot;Streams&quot; need to be built.<p>Thinking about scenarios, example &quot;Sign up&quot; is not really just  &quot;Create a user row in db&quot; but probably assign them a group also, and more.<p>Similarly, we rarely would use a &quot;R&quot; in CRUD (except administrators).

And by this I mean that if you were to look at the manifold of problems solvable using current techniques in amount of time x, you would find that in general that manifold is a long way away from the manifold of useful business applications. I&#x27;m not saying that there is a better decomposition - a better decomposition that leads to a manifold that lies closer to the target manifold - it may be that the manifold is complex in a way that makes it impossible to approximate efficiently in terms of time to develop.<p>And we may be butting up against the fact that most objects in mathematical space do not have effecient ways of representing them.

And Gulp vs Grunt, and UMD vs CommonJS, Bower vs NPM. React and Angular4 are very, very new relatively, and they evolve pretty fast, with breaking changes. A company betting on building a CRUD &#x2F; UI builder needs to go into market in a few months or it&#x27;s already behind.<p>Take a look at react studio (see comment here). They are a great tool probably, but they are focused on one popular library at the moment.

The alternative is to generate code that doesn&#x27;t try to be &quot;latest and greatest&quot; at all, and not really care (see wix code post earlier today)... but not sure it&#x27;s a great bet as well.<p>I think back in the day, there were just less options to choose from when building apps, and they evolved slower. This is why in the desktop days we had a lot more robust UI builder, app builders (Every IDE has top notch visual destkop UI editor, but also good old Magic, MS Access, FileMaker etc...).<p>I do think this is begging to be changed.

Even among the tech industry's most valuable companies, two of the more visible CEOs, Google's Sundar Pichai, and Microsoft's Satya Nadella, are both Indian. Which is why it might come as a surprise that Asians\u2014especially Asian women\u2014are among the least likely to be promoted into leadership positions, according to a new study from <a href=\"http://www.ascendleadership.org\" target=\"_blank\" data-reactid=\"250\">Ascend Leadership</a>, a nonprofit group for Asian professionals.</p><p data-reactid=\"252\">\u201cThat\u2019s why we call the report the Illusion of Asian Success,\u201d says Buck Gee, a former vice president at Cisco and one of the authors of the study. The natural assumption is that if Asians are more prevalent in the workforce, they will be more prevalent at the top. But \u201cwhen you look at the hard data, that is a fallacy,\u201d says Gee.</p><p data-reactid=\"253\">Gee and his co-author Denise Peck, also a former vice president at Cisco, studied a data set of 184,776 employees, 63,299 managers, and 12,856 executives, information collected by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission between 2007 and 2015 from technology companies in the San Francisco and San Jose areas, a group that covers Apple, Facebook, Cisco, Twitter, Intel, HP, and Yelp. (The EEOC has this data because Title VII of the Civil Rights act requires private employers with more than 100 employees to submit confidential reports.)  The study focuses only on the promotion within an organization, not hiring or retention. The authors measured leadership representation by comparing the percentage of entry-level \u201cprofessionals\u201d from a particular group, say Asian women, the percentage of \u201cexecutives,\u201d according to job categories in the EEOC reports, which also includes \u201cadministrative support\u201d and \u201cservice workers.\u201d</p><p data-reactid=\"287\">After sifting through the data, the authors concluded that race is a stronger impediment than gender when it comes to climbing Silicon Valley\u2019s corporate ladder. Representation of white women in leadership roles improved by 17 percent between 2007 and 2015, whereas for all other minority groups, the percentage went down.</p><p data-reactid=\"288\">\u201cWhite women are continuing to benefit from the system of racism, even when they are also experiencing discrimination because of their gender,\u201d says Hannah Lucal, associate director at <a href=\"http://breakingthemold.openmic.org\" target=\"_blank\" data-reactid=\"290\">Open Mic</a>, a nonprofit group that works with socially conscious investors. Lucal says that companies should approach the issue with an understanding that sexism and racism are structural issues that always operating in tandem, rather than interpret studies like this as a hierarchy of discrimination.</p><figure class=\"image-embed-component\" data-reactid=\"292\"><p class=\"component-lazy pending\" data-component=\"Lazy\" data-reactid=\"293\"/><figcaption class=\"caption-component\" data-reactid=\"294\"><p class=\"caption-component__credit-container\" data-reactid=\"296\"><i aria-label=\"Photo attribution\" class=\" ui-chart icon icon--16\" data-reactid=\"297\"/><cite class=\"caption-component__credit\" data-reactid=\"298\">Ascend Leadership</cite></p></figcaption></figure><p data-reactid=\"299\">Ascend\u2019s findings revealed unique diversity issues for each segment. For black women, the data pointed to potential hiring and retention issues. There was a 13 percent decline from 2007 and 2015 in the number of black women who even entered the tech workforce. The number of Hispanic women, on the other hand, declined slightly at the professional and managerial level, but they had the worst leadership representation after Asian women.</p><p data-reactid=\"302\">Gee says this study came about because an earlier <a href=\"http://c.ymcdn.com/sites/ascendleadership.site-ym.com/resource/resmgr/Research/HiddenInPlainSight_Paper_042.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" data-reactid=\"304\">report in 2015</a> that used EEOC data from companies like Google and LinkedIn ended up on the desk of Jenny Yang, the outgoing commissioner of the EEOC. Yang asked if the lower proportion of Asian executives was the result of discrimination and might be applicable for lawsuits, Gee says. He told her no. \u201cWe have never seen any overt discrimination or policies that create these disparities,\u201d Gee explains. Rather, after conversations with 60 or 70 Asian executives, the authors say they noticed a pattern of cultural traits among some Asians that did not align with leadership expectations in Western corporate culture, such as risk-taking and being confrontational.</p><p data-reactid=\"306\">Gee gave the example of an executive who started the first Asian affinity group at Intel decades ago. He noticed that Chinese engineers were unhappy and not succeeding in Intel\u2019s culture of \u201cconstructive conflict,\u201d which involved heated debates during meetings.</p><p data-reactid=\"307\">\u201cSome people call it unconscious bias. For Asians, it\u2019s actually a very conscious bias,\u201d says Gee. Studies show that assumptions that Asians are good at math, science, and technology make it easier for them to get in the door, but the same bias is reversed when it comes to leadership roles, he says.</p><p data-reactid=\"308\">Department of Labor lawsuits have touched on differential treatment at tech companies based on race. In April, Palantir paid a $1.7 million settlement after a Department of Labor investigation found discrimination against Asian employees. There is an ongoing <a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ofccp/ofccp20170118-0\" target=\"_blank\" data-reactid=\"310\">investigation</a> into Oracle for favoring Asian workers in recruiting and hiring for technical roles, but paying white men more than women, black, and Asian employees.</p><p data-reactid=\"312\">Several advocates and investors have pressured publically-traded companies like Apple and Alphabet to better diversify their ranks. In 2015, Jesse Jackson\u2019s group Rainbow PUSH Coalition, a nonprofit, began demanding diversity numbers from tech companies, including showing up at shareholder meetings for Facebook and Amazon. In a statement to WIRED, Jackson said, \u201cTech companies over and over have said they 'must do better' but the fact remains that blacks and Latinos still make up just 2 to 3 percent of the tech workforce, even less representation in the C-suites and board rooms.\u201d</p><p data-reactid=\"313\">Zevin Asset Management, a firm with more than $600 million under management, has made a shareholder proposal to increase diversity at Apple. Pat Miguel Tomaino, an associate director of socially responsible investing at Zevin, has long been concerned about the lack of diversity in the tech sector becoming a material issue that affects hiring talented people and representing the needs of their consumers. Tech has been talking a good game \u201cand then falling on their faces when it comes time to train, properly incentive, and promote those talented people,\u201d costing the company time and money for preventable reasons, he says.</p><p data-reactid=\"314\">Lucal says that the conversation about diversity in the tech industry needs to move beyond just the numbers and examine who has power in terms of influence and decision-making. Otherwise, efforts to improve diversity are limited to who is in the room, and not who is at the table. Studies like this show it\u2019s time for a new table, she says.</p></div></div></body></html>"}, "15429109": {"score": 59, "comments": ["This looks very interesting (and I am interested) but the article seems like a stub.

You can create a replicated application really fast. This is because the application doesn't store any data and simple load balancing will do the job when it comes to scaling it. However, if you want to run any application that stores the data somewhere, you care about the order how the application is started, or you want a stable hostname and network ID, then we are talking about the stateful applications and in Kubernetes world <code>StatefulSet</code> is the type of workload object you need to use. Unlike <code>Deployment</code> there are some differences. This post will help you to get started.</p>\n<h3 id=\"statefulapplication\">Stateful application</h3>\n<p>I will not show just another example of <code>StatefulSet</code> workload definition. There are many examples available out there. So, find one and start it. Now, if you list Pods of stateful application, the first thing you will notice is that the Pods are not named with some autogenerated IDs, instead, you will get something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>$ kubectl get po\nNAME          READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\nzookeeper-0   1/1       Running   0          31m\nzookeeper-1   1/1       Running   0          31m\nzookeeper-2   1/1       Running   0          31m\n</code></pre>\n<p>As you can see each Pod will get a unique and stable name of the form <code>&lt;StatefulSet-Name&gt;-&lt;Ordinal-Index&gt;</code>. Also, because the controller starts Pods one at a time, <code>zookeeper-1</code> will not be deployed before <code>zookeeper-0</code> is running and ready (you can achieve this with liveness and readiness probes).</p>\n<h3 id=\"headlessservice\">Headless service</h3>\n<p>To ensure stable network ID you need to define a headless service for stateful applications. The definition of headless service is similar to the standard service, but it doesn't have the <code>clusterIP</code>. Simply adding <code>clusterIP: none</code> in yaml definition will create a headless service. Here is one example:</p>\n<pre><code>apiVersion: v1\nkind: Service\nmetadata:\n  name: zookeeper-server\n  labels:\n    app: zookeeper\nspec:\n  clusterIP: None # &lt;--\n  ports:\n  - port: 2888\n    name: server\n  - port: 3888\n    name: leader-election\n  selector:\n    app: zookeeper\n</code></pre>\n<p>In above example we defined headless service just for zookeeper servers, clients could use a standard service. Note that you can always define multiple services for one Kubernetes workload object. So, how is headless service different?</p>\n<p>The main benefit of using a headless service is to be able to reach each Pod directly. If this is a standard service, then the service would act as a load balancer or proxy and you would access your workload object just using the service name <code>zookeeper-server</code>. With headless service, the Pod <code>zookeeper-0</code> could use <code>zookeeper-1.zookeeper-server</code> to talk to <code>zookeeper-1</code> directly. The form is <code>&lt;StatefulSet-Name&gt;-&lt;Ordinal-Index&gt;.&lt;ServiceName&gt;</code>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"poddiscoverywithnslookup\">Pod discovery with nslookup</h3>\n<p>With headless service, we could easily discover other Pods in one <code>StatefulSet</code> workload with a simple tool like <code>nslookup</code>. Let's take a look at those two examples:</p>\n<p>Standard service - you will get the <code>clusterIP</code> value:</p>\n<pre><code>$ kubectl exec zookeeper-0 -- nslookup zookeeper\nServer:        10.0.0.10\nAddress:    10.0.0.10#53\n\nName:    zookeeper.default.svc.cluster.local\nAddress: 10.0.0.213\n</code></pre>\n<p>Headless service - you will get the IP of each Pod:</p>\n<pre><code>$ kubectl exec zookeeper-0 -- nslookup zookeeper\nServer:        10.0.0.10\nAddress:    10.0.0.10#53\n\nName:    zookeeper.default.svc.cluster.local\nAddress: 172.17.0.6\nName:    zookeeper.default.svc.cluster.local\nAddress: 172.17.0.7\nName:    zookeeper.default.svc.cluster.local\nAddress: 172.17.0.8\n</code></pre>\n<p>Those two examples are just to show you how two types of Kuberntes services are different. Something like this cannot be used in start scripts because Pods are started one by one and only the latest pod could discover other pods.</p>\n<h3 id=\"operators\">Operators</h3>\n<p>All looks great, but there is a minor problem with <code>StatefulSet</code> workloads. Kubernetes cannot provide a general solution for stateful applications, so you might need to look at Kubernetes Operators. If you think about this, each stateful application acts differently and it is almost impossible to generalize all of them to <code>StatefulSet</code> and expect to work seamlessly. Kubernetes would need to have a different workload API for each application type and that is not likely to happen. Instead, there are Operators which are created for specific stateful applications. Here are some of them:</p>\n\n<p>So, the question is, should you create or use an Operator for each stateful application? Probably not, and you could just use <code>StatefulSet</code> to work with your stateful application, but scaling it, upgrading and any operational stuff need to be done manually with a lot of testing and planning. Don't expect for Kubernetes to solve that. If you really don't want to run stateful applications inside Kuberntes and you want to use them externally, you could do that too. That is actually a great idea for easier transition of production workloads. Check <a href=\"https://akomljen.com/kubernetes-tips-part-1\">my previous blog post</a> if you want to see how to access external services from Kubernetes, the right way.</p>\n<h3 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h3>\n<p>This was just a small introduction to <code>StatefulSet</code> workloads. There are many great things about it, rolling upgrades are also available from Kubernetes v1.7 and above, but as many other things they are not perfect and I think that Operators are here to solve that. To be precise, Operators are using <code>StatefulSet</code> features and they are just another layer above to make things easier.</p>\n</div>&#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div></body></html>"}, "15429014": {"score": 2, "comments": [], "time": "2017-10-08 20:14:47", "url": "https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/qvj5vp/piloted-aircraft-flight-speed-record-1967-nasa-air-force-william-knight-x-15", "text": "<html><body><div><div class=\"article__body\"><p>This week marked the 50th anniversary of the fastest ever piloted aircraft flight, when Major William J. \"Pete\" Knight brought the rocket-powered X-15 A-2 to a speed of 4,520 miles per hour\u2014over six times the speed of sound\u2014in <a href=\"https://history.nasa.gov/monograph31.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">October 1967</a>. </p> <p>This is distinct from the air speed record, because this record necessitates a pilot.

How has the flight speed record for a piloted aircraft held up for half a century? </p> <p>The answer to this question is buried in the history of the X-15, an unmistakable product of its moment.</p> <p>In 1967, the US military was still financing the <a href=\"http://www.inquiriesjournal.com/articles/749/the-military-industrial-complex-in-the-united-states-evolution-and-expansion-from-world-war-ii-to-the-war-on-terror\" target=\"_blank\">military-industrial complex</a> that emerged during World War II. <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/military-spending/\" target=\"_blank\">While military spending</a> in countries like the UK, France, and Germany plummeted to about one third of their peak war spending after 1946, the US maintained almost half of its military spending. In the 25 years after WWII, America funnelled about $328 billion (adjusted for inflation in the year 2000) annually to its military.</p> <p class=\"article__embed article__embed--ourworldindata\"/> <p>For agencies like NASA and the US Air Force, this spending was used to fund experimental vehicles and technologies.</p> <p>The X-15 \"<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/pdf/87756main_H-524.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">research airplane</a>\" was one of over 30 \"<a href=\"https://history.nasa.gov/monograph31.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">X-vehicles</a>\" produced by US military agencies like the Air Force, the Navy, and NASA between 1946 and 1971. These X-vehicles, mainly airplanes and missiles, were experimental technologies designed in hopes of achieving record altitudes and hypersonic speeds. </p> <p>These extreme vehicles were tested in the remoteness of the Nevadan desert, <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/centers/armstrong/news/FactSheets/FS-052-DFRC.html\" target=\"_blank\">with the aim of</a> producing data that could be used to design spacecrafts\u2014specifically, ones that could carry humans.

Out of the <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/centers/armstrong/news/FactSheets/FS-052-DFRC.html\" target=\"_blank\">twelve people</a> who flew the X-15, Major Pete Knight was a safe pick for the job. He already had three years of experience with the X-15 after being personally recruited from a training program at the Aerospace Research Pilot School.</p> <p>(If Knight's name sounds familiar, it's probably because he's famously homophobic. He <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/no-to-gay-marriage-in-ca/\" target=\"_blank\">introduced the bill</a> that made same-sex marriage illegal in California back in 2000 when he was a state senator.)</p> <p>But despite Knight's experience as a pilot, the risks of the flight were clear. In June of 1967, Knight experienced engine failure while piloting the X-15 <a href=\"https://www.historychannel.com.au/this-day-in-history/knight-sets-speed-record-for-manned-aircraft/\" target=\"_blank\">107,000 feet above Earth</a>. He had to make an emergency landing in the middle of Nevada's Mud Lake. </p> <p>Knight wasn't the only pilot who had to make emergency landings. In fact, they had been happening for years, and injuries <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=gb5nBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA171&amp;lpg=PA171&amp;dq=200th+flight+x-15+21+November+1968,&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=35TLkPl6os&amp;sig=l-RUaEL6MJ9IQCBqdjm3PjmKDZs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjZvZawxtfWAhUq5YMKHY2QC-oQ6AEILDAB#v=snippet&amp;q=injuries&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\">were commonplace</a>.</p> <p>One of the most severe X-15 emergency landings was on November 9, 1962.

On the October 3 flight, <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/centers/armstrong/news/FactSheets/FS-052-DFRC.html\" target=\"_blank\">Knight accelerated</a> to 4,520 miles per hour and was able to keep control of the aircraft.</p><p>Although the X-15 was a record-breaking aircraft, it wasn't safe to fly. Just weeks after Knight's flight, Major Michael Adams died during an experimental X-15 flight.</p> <p>Adams was sent to test the X-15's altitude limits, and was able to climb <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/news/X-Press/stories/2004/073004/ppl_adams.html\" target=\"_blank\">50 miles</a> above Earth, into the <a href=\"https://scied.ucar.edu/atmosphere-layers\" target=\"_blank\">Thermosphere</a>. That's high enough for a satellite to <a href=\"https://scied.ucar.edu/shortcontent/thermosphere-overview\" target=\"_blank\">enter orbit</a> around the Earth, but the Air Force explicitly incentivized pilots to reach these dangerous heights. In fact, the Air Force <a href=\"http://www.thecharterstore.com/blog/north-american-x-15/\" target=\"_blank\">awarded astronaut wings</a> to pilots who reached fifty mile-altitudes.</p> <p>But as Adams tried to descend, electrical disturbances damaged the X-15's guidance and reaction controls. Adams lost control of the plane, which spun at hypersonic speeds as it plunged to the ground below. Suffering from vertigo, Adams was unable to exit the plane and died when the X-15 crashed into the Mojave Desert. He was 37.</p><p>Despite this tragedy, the X-15 was flown nine more times in the following year. Major Knight was scheduled to take it on its 200th flight in November 1968, but after <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=gb5nBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA171&amp;lpg=PA171&amp;dq=200th+flight+x-15+21+November+1968,&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=35TLkPl6os&amp;sig=l-RUaEL6MJ9IQCBqdjm3PjmKDZs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjZvZawxtfWAhUq5YMKHY2QC-oQ6AEILDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=200th&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\">a series of technical problems</a> the flight was cancelled and the X-15 was officially retired. And while X-vehicle experimentation <a href=\"https://history.nasa.gov/monograph31.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">ran until 1971</a>, no test was designed to break the speed record for piloted aircrafts set by the X-15.<br/></p> <p>So why haven't we broken the speed record for piloted aircrafts in 50 years?</p> <p>It's possible that with the success of the Apollo program and the development of powerful nuclear weapons, the US simply lost interest in testing the boundaries of piloted flight speeds. </p> <p>But after the loss of Adams's life and close calls with pilots such as McKay, NASA also started to more carefully evaluate when pilots are necessary.</p> <p>This caution is evident in NASA's current approach to research aircrafts. A <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/fs-108-afrc.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">NASA fact sheet</a> regarding its Prototype-Technology Evaluation and Research Aircraft (PTERA) explains that all testing is conducted in a laboratory:</p> <p class=\"article__blockquote\"><i>\"The ability to alter PTERA's configuration allows cost-effective testing of unconventional designs that might otherwise be too dangerous or expensive to test with a full-scale, crewed aircraft.\"</i></p> <p>Pilots may be safe from dangerous hypersonic flight tests, but this risk may have shifted toward people on the ground. American, Chinese, and Russian air forces currently <a href=\"http://www.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/1177338/accelerating-hypersonics-development/\" target=\"_blank\">are all conducting</a> hypersonic drone tests. In fact, these countries have <a href=\"https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/bjvb4w/beware-hypersonic-missiles\">already developed</a> hypersonic missiles that can travel more than 3,000 miles per hour.</p> <p>These weapons could become commonplace in future warfare, which is an unsettling prospect. Imagine cheaply made, unmanned aerial vehicles that bomb areas and leave, all before people on the ground even hear the detonation. </p> <p>X-15 testing undoubtedly raised important ethical concerns about the relationship between humans and their hypersonic creations. Although its piloted flight speed record has stood for fifty years, these ethical concerns are far from obsolete.</p><p><b> <i> Get six of our favorite Motherboard stories every day </i></b><b><i><a href=\"http://motherboard.club/\" target=\"_blank\">by signing up for our newsletter</a>.</i></b></p></div>\n            </div></body></html>"}, "15429116": {"score": 1, "comments": [], "time": "2017-10-08 20:42:25", "url": "https://medium.com/@iacobson/subscribe-genstages-under-umbrella-1fceec366633", "text": "<html><body><div><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><h1 name=\"ceca\" id=\"ceca\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf--leading graf--title\">Subscribe GenStages Under\u00a0Umbrella</h1><h2 name=\"3c25\" id=\"3c25\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3 graf--subtitle\">GenStage Under Umbrella\u200a\u2014\u200aPart\u00a04</h2><p name=\"14eb\" id=\"14eb\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--mixtapeEmbed\">This is the last article in the GenStage under Umbrella series, and the shortest.

Basically, we do not have control over the application start order in a \u201cflat umbrella\u201d architecture. So we cannot guarantee that the producer is up when the consumer tries to subscribe.</p><p name=\"6299\" id=\"6299\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">What can we do about it?</p><p name=\"d0fe\" id=\"d0fe\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">At <a href=\"https://www.fitzdares.com/careers/ruby\" data-href=\"https://www.fitzdares.com/careers/ruby\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Fitzdares</a>, we use this <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">GenStage under Umbrella</strong> architecture for one of our current Elixir projects.

The only proviso was that we should limit the amount of Irish whiskey we used because IDV didn\u2019t have any strong relationships with Irish distilleries and wouldn\u2019t be able to control supply of the stuff.</p>\n                \n                                \n                                </div>                                                                 <div amp-access=\"authorized = true\">\n                         \n<p class=\"no_name\">Hugh stared at the ceiling. His morning coffee hadn\u2019t kicked in yet and he was a self-confessed slow starter. I was still seething from his languid entrance to the office 90 minutes after mine.</p>\n                \n                                \n                                </div>                                                                 <div amp-access=\"authorized = true\">\n                         \n<p class=\"no_name\">We were, I suppose, unlikely business partners. Hugh Reade Seymour-Davies was a toff. He was a \u201cgentleman copywriter\u201d, educated at Eton and Oxford, and an unapologetic classicist. He could quote all the Latin and Greek greats with real facility and would \u201cget some Latin in\u201d to documents or labels when I felt we needed to impress some of our more intellectual clients. He was steeped in Shakespeare, admired Beethoven and Mozart certainly, but anything written, composed or painted after about 1830 fell into the category of mid-19th century arrivistes.</p>\n                \n                                                            \n                                                    \n                                </div>                                                                 <div amp-access=\"authorized = true\">\n                         \n<p class=\"no_name\">I, on the other hand, was most definitely an arriviste, having fled South Africa in 1961 aboard the Cape Town Castle to occupy a mattress on a floor in a shared room in Earl\u2019s Court. Leaving behind me a possessive Jewish family, I\u2019d escaped to London to make my way in advertising. Just before I left South Africa, where I\u2019d been involved with ads for medicines to cure piles and devising promotions for patent fingernail clippers.</p>\n                \n                                \n                                </div>                                                                 <div amp-access=\"authorized = true\">\n                         \n<figure class=\"inline__content inline__content--image\"> \n <amp-img alt=\"An early design idea for Baileys\" src=\"/polopoly_fs/1.3240939!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/image.jpg\" layout=\"responsive\"/> \n <figcaption>\n   Bob Wagner's early design idea for Baileys \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p class=\"no_name\">We chatted aimlessly for a few minutes about the Irish brief and then I raised the issue of my previous Irish involvement. \u201cCan we take anything from my Kerrygold butter experience?\u201d I said. (I was in the team that created the Kerrygold brand in the early 1960s.) \u201cIs there something in Ireland\u2019s reputation for dairy produce that we can apply to an alcoholic drink \u2013 all those lush green, rain-sodden pastures and contented cows?\u201d</p>\n                \n                                \n                                </div>                                                                 <div amp-access=\"authorized = true\">\n                         \n<p class=\"no_name\">Hugh looked at me with an almost earnest stare. \u201cWhat would happen if we mixed Irish whiskey and cream?\u201d he said. \u201cThat might be interesting.\u201d He sat back and waited for a response.</p>\n                \n                                \n                                </div>                                                                 <div amp-access=\"authorized = true\">\n                         \n<p class=\"no_name\">\u201cLet\u2019s try it,\u201d I replied. Where Hugh was more likely to intellectualise and think through the appalling consequences of dropping cream into Ireland\u2019s beloved whiskey, I was all for doing it there and then. I jumped up, almost grabbed him by the lapels and marched him out into the street and into what was then International Stores at the southern end of Berwick Street market in the middle of Soho. It was the nearest supermarket to our office.</p>\n                \n                                \n                                </div>                                                                 <div amp-access=\"authorized = true\">\n                         \n<p class=\"no_name\">We bought a small bottle of Jamesons Irish Whiskey and a tub of single cream and hurried back. It was a lovely May morning. 1973. Underdogs Sunderland had just won the FA Cup. We mixed the two ingredients in our kitchen, tasted the result and it was certainly intriguing, but in reality bloody awful. Undaunted, we threw in some sugar and it got better, but it still missed something.</p>\n                \n                                                            \n                                                    \n                                </div>                                                                 <div amp-access=\"authorized = true\">\n                         \n<p class=\"no_name\">We went back to the store, searching the shelves for something else, found our salvation in Cadbury\u2019s Powdered Drinking Chocolate and added it to our formula. Hugh and I were taken by surprise. It tasted really good. Not only this, but the cream seemed to have the effect of making the drink taste stronger, like full-strength spirit. It was extraordinary.</p>\n                \n                                \n                                </div>                                                                 <div amp-access=\"authorized = true\">\n                         \n<p class=\"no_name\">The whole process had taken about 45 minutes, from the moment Hugh looked at me to the moment we poured our mixture into a cleaned-out screw-top Schweppes\u2019 tonic bottle and I called Tom Jago, our client at IDV. I suggested that we meet immediately. I went on my own. Either Hugh had had second thoughts and decided that the gentry at IDV would cast out our muddy concoction with suitable disdain \u2013 or he didn\u2019t have an available suit hanging up in the office. I suspect it was the latter. Ten minutes later I was in a cab heading for 1 York Gate, an elegant Georgian house in the outer circle of London\u2019s beautiful Regent\u2019s Park.</p>\n                \n                                \n                                </div>                                                                 <div amp-access=\"authorized = true\">\n                         \n<p class=\"no_name\">In the cab I tried to bring some logic to this wacky idea. Apart from the great taste, which triggered the thought that \u201calcoholic drinks don\u2019t have to taste punishing\u201d, I was interested in our serendipitous discovery that the drink tasted stronger than it really was. I think our original mix was, very roughly, 25 per cent alcohol by volume. Maybe it could be pitched against stronger liqueurs like Tia Maria, where it would appear to be as strong, but would attract much lower duty. It could therefore be more profitable. I was excited. Very excited. Convinced we\u2019d cracked the Irish brief.</p>\n                \n                                \n                                </div>                                                                 <div amp-access=\"authorized = true\">\n                         \n<blockquote class=\"inline__content inline__content--pullquote\">\n  Gilbeys had reached an agreement with the Irish finance minister that export earnings on the new brand would be tax exempt for a period of 10 years \n</blockquote> \n<p class=\"no_name\">We had just started out as an independent business a few weeks earlier and I don\u2019t think we took in that this was an imperative brief that had to be solved in a hurry. It was just something that cropped up in a casual conversation with Tom. We saw nothing in writing. I was to discover some time later, a lot later, that Gilbeys of Ireland management had reached an agreement with the Irish finance minister that export earnings on the new brand would be tax exempt for a period of 10 years. I seem to recall that at the time of the Baileys\u2019 10th anniversary party \u2013 and it was some party \u2013 the company had sold about 4 million cases the previous year. Who needed a written brief?</p>\n                \n                                                            \n                                                    \n                                </div>                                                                 <div amp-access=\"authorized = true\">\n                         \n<blockquote class=\"inline__content inline__content--pullquote\">\n  I have come to the conclusion that the real heroes of ideas are not the people who have them \u2013 they are the people who buy them \n</blockquote> \n<p class=\"no_name\">When I got to York Gate I went in to see Tom to present our mucky brown liquid in its recycled bottle with huge enthusiasm. He liked it immediately. Over the years I have come to the conclusion that the real heroes of ideas are not the people who have them \u2013 they are the people who buy them. Tom could easily have said, \u201cSorry old chap, but it\u2019s not our sort of thing\u201d \u2013 which it really wasn\u2019t, given the strong focus on wine, sherry, and \u201cserious\u201d spirits like gin, whisky and vodka at IDV. But he was as excited as we were about our Heath Robinson product.</p>\n                \n                                \n                                </div>                                                                 <div amp-access=\"authorized = true\">\n                         \n<p class=\"no_name\">Given the totally revolutionary nature of the product, and the fact that nothing like it had ever been made before, we decided that we would develop it completely before we showed it to the Irish. This was odd coming from both Tom Jago and me, as we were both terribly impatient. (His attention span was not of heroic proportions and I once considered petitioning for the word \u201cjago\u201d to become adopted as a unit of measurement for attention deficit syndrome). But in this instance we had to take our time about it: there were too many imponderables about our creation. It could turn out to be a very tough sell. Or no sell at all.</p>\n                \n                                \n                                </div>                                                                 <div amp-access=\"authorized = true\">\n                         \n<figure class=\"inline__content inline__content--image\"> \n <amp-img alt=\"Mac Macpherson, second-in-command at Gilbeys research laboratory in Harlow, Essex, and an unidentified colleague.

They were boffins or techies and knew about the science of drink production. Mac was in a white coat while Alan looked like the proprietor of a fine wine emporium. \u201cGood suit,\u201d I thought. I stood in Alan\u2019s office with our precious bottle burning a hole in my raincoat pocket. I was eager for him to taste it there and then. He wasn\u2019t quite so keen and when I read his lips the words \u201clater perhaps\u201d seemed to form.</p>\n                \n                                                            \n                                                    \n                                </div>                                                                 <div amp-access=\"authorized = true\">\n                         \n<p class=\"no_name\">\u201cAfter lunch\u201d he said and steered us towards a burgundy tasting. Oh dear. He was a wine man at heart. It didn\u2019t help that I managed to get quite a bit of wine over my tie and the style of my spitting left much to be desired. They finally tasted our concoction after lunch \u2013 after a bottle of decent red \u2013 and there was no doubt, by the expression on their faces, that they thought it was quite disgusting. It wasn\u2019t a fine wine after all. It didn\u2019t look like wine. It didn\u2019t look like any known liqueur and it didn\u2019t even taste like whiskey. What was it? We\u2019d gambled on the fact that they might like the taste, but it was evident that they did not. Perhaps it had aged in the five days since we made it.</p>\n                \n                                \n                                </div>                                                                 <div amp-access=\"authorized = true\">\n                         \n<p class=\"no_name\">Yet strangely Mac looked up to us from his awful beige-streaked glass and nodded almost imperceptibly. Whatever we were doing, no matter what he thought of the taste, he knew what we were aiming for. Just a nod, that\u2019s all he gave us. Not a yes but better than a no. Mac would be the man who would have to run with this. And he did.</p>\n                \n                                \n                                </div>                                                                 <div amp-access=\"authorized = true\">\n                         \n<p class=\"no_name\">Although IDV didn\u2019t have the technology to mix alcohol and cream together, Tom insisted that the team apply resources to studying it. The technical challenge was under way and Tom was now in a hurry to do the branding: the bottle, the label and the name.</p>\n                \n                                \n                                </div>                                                                 <div amp-access=\"authorized = true\">\n                         \n<p class=\"no_name\">I remembered once, during the Kerrygold days, being told by a well-known Irishman that so many Irish names sound quaint when applied to brands. His name was Tony O\u2019Reilly and O\u2019Reilly\u2019s Irish Cream might indeed have sounded a bit whimsical. I could see what he meant and it had stuck in my mind. We needed what they called an \u201cAnglo-Irish\u201d name. We were sure that a family name might be better than a \u201cthing\u201d or a place name. That was the popular convention of the business in those days. After all, many drinks were named after the people who made them.</p>\n                \n                                \n                                </div>                                                                 <div amp-access=\"authorized = true\">\n                         \n<p class=\"no_name\">As the office that Hugh and I shared in Dean Street was only temporary accommodation, we were planning a move within Soho.

We visited some premises in nearby Greek Street, alongside a pub called The Pillars of Hercules and above a restaurant of no fixed ethnicity that was called Baileys Bistro.</p>\n                \n                                                                                                                                            \n             \n        <aside amp-access=\"authorized = true\" class=\"inline-related\" id=\"related-art\">\n    <h3>Related</h3>\n    \n    </aside>\n                                                                                    \n                                </div>                                                                 <div amp-access=\"authorized = true\">\n                         \n<figure class=\"inline__content inline__content--image\"> \n <amp-img alt=\"The Soho bistro, next door to the Pillar of Hercules pub, that gave Baileys its name\" src=\"/polopoly_fs/1.3240938!/image/image.jpg\" layout=\"responsive\"/> \n <figcaption>\n   The Soho bistro, next door to the Pillar of Hercules pub, that gave Baileys its name \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p class=\"no_name\">We were still struggling to find a name for our revolutionary new drink and there it was; above the door. Baileys. Was it really right in front of my face? It was certainly Anglo-Irish and in a flurry of post-rationalisation I managed to dredge up from my memory a dairy of that name in the Port Elizabeth of my youth in South Africa. This gave it a kind of relevance in my head. I called Tom: \u201cHow about Baileys Irish Cream?\u201d I proffered hopefully, \u201cIt sounds right, perfect I think.\u201d</p>\n                \n                                \n                                </div>                                                                 <div amp-access=\"authorized = true\">\n                         \n<p class=\"no_name\">Without any hesitation he bought the name. He was like that. If he saw an idea and it worked for him he could be very quick on the draw. We designated it an \u201cIrish Cream Chocolate Liqueur\u201d. Names can be tough and often really easy to reject with a comment like \u201cI just don\u2019t like it\u201d.</p>\n                \n                                \n                                </div>                                                                 <div amp-access=\"authorized = true\">\n                         \n<p class=\"no_name\">Being words, not graphic designs, they are within everyone\u2019s purview so anyone can reject them. Getting to Baileys as quickly as we did was unusual. Indeed, as I discovered in later years, it was incredible.</p>\n                \n                                \n                                </div>                                                                 <div amp-access=\"authorized = true\">\n                         \n<p class=\"no_name\">A few weeks later I telephoned my mother. \u201cWas there a dairy in Port Elizabeth called Baileys back in the early days? I\u2019m sure I can remember it.\u201d \u201cNo\u201d she said \u201cDefinitely not\u201d. There went our brand\u2019s \u201ccertificate of provenance\u201d. I would have to settle for Messrs Chesterman and Cymberg, owners of Baileys Bistro and our future landlords. Not an especially Irish pair.</p>\n                \n                                \n                                </div>                                                                 <div amp-access=\"authorized = true\">\n                         \n<p class=\"no_name\">The next step was packaging, and we needed a bottle. Not being confident enough in the overall idea to suggest spending money on a new mould which could have run to several thousand pounds, we looked around for an existing bottle and Tom found one for an Irish whiskey brand that the company distributed called Redbreast. We decided we\u2019d use that.</p>\n                \n                                \n                                </div>                                                                 <div amp-access=\"authorized = true\">\n                         \n<p class=\"no_name\">It was brown glass, squat and round like a typical liqueur bottle and seemed very appropriate for Baileys. But there was a problem: it had a prominent R embossed on the shoulder of the bottle. I guess we could have changed Baileys to a name beginning with R, but Baileys was now fixed in our minds and it would have been hard to change. We had started to use it in conversation.</p>\n                \n                                \n                                </div>                                                                 <div amp-access=\"authorized = true\">\n                         \n<p class=\"no_name\">We also had to give it an address, so the very first label carried the legend \u201cThe Dairy Distillery, County Monaghan\u201d. It was a complete fabrication of mine \u2013 but it sounded good. And very Kerrygold. Hugh and I had a secretary called Amy Wagner. Her husband Bob was a graphic designer and they lived on a small boat on the Thames at Kingston. Rather than drag Bob all the way in to London when he could be working, I wrote out a design brief and asked Amy to show it to him and get him to submit some designs as soon as he could. The brief asked for Kerrygold butter styling \u2013 but for an alcoholic drink: contented grazing cows and lush green pastures \u2013 we wanted an Irish rustic idyll on a label.</p>\n                \n                                \n                                </div>                                                                 <div amp-access=\"authorized = true\">\n                         \n<p class=\"no_name\">A couple of days later Bob delivered. I think in those early times he was paid five guineas a design and he had sent about 20 for us to choose from. Amy laid them out on our table and Tom, Hugh and I looked them over and immediately lit on one. That was it. We even liked the streaky magic marker khaki that was the dominant colour.</p>\n                \n                                \n                                </div>                                                                 <div amp-access=\"authorized = true\">\n                         \n<p class=\"no_name\">It was pretty close to the Baileys label that you see today, give or take several tweaks and many millions of pounds over the last 40 years.</p>\n                \n                                \n                                </div>                                                                 <div amp-access=\"authorized = true\">\n                         \n<p class=\"no_name\">These were still early days in our product development lives and there was a huge buzz seeing an idea begin to assume a physical form. I was no designer so depended on other people to perform this magic. We had another cunning plan. Let\u2019s not rush to Dublin with their new drink yet. Let\u2019s show the Baileys bottle with a printed label. In those days we usually dealt in rough designs rendered with crayons and magic marker pens. There were no computers to produce perfect facsimiles of the real thing. We felt that showing Baileys as a rough design would make it look like a tentative idea: one which people would want to change and modify. We wanted Baileys to look irresistibly authentic.</p>\n                \n                                \n                                </div>                                                                 <div amp-access=\"authorized = true\">\n                         \n<p class=\"no_name\">The liquid product itself started to take shape in the June and July of 1973 but there were two other things we wanted to do before making the journey to Dublin. We would set up some focus groups, in which we would present Baileys in a proper bottle \u2013 as if it already existed \u2013 and ask real potential customers what they thought about it. That would be the theoretical world.</p>\n                \n                                \n                                </div>                                                                 <div amp-access=\"authorized = true\">\n                         \n<p class=\"no_name\">Secondly, we would put a couple of bottles into a bar and see if anyone actually asked for it and paid for a glass. That would be the real world. It was small stuff really. In those days market research was not the all-powerful force it is today, and it certainly wasn\u2019t in the drinks trade. But we thought it would make us look professional when we went to Dublin for the Big Sell. Cream and chocolate with Irish whiskey needed all the help it could get.</p>\n                \n                                \n                                </div>                                                                 <div amp-access=\"authorized = true\">\n                         \n<p class=\"no_name\">When the night of the focus group came, I looked nervously around the room. This was the male group. But then these were men who were prepared to turn up for a free drink and get paid for it. We showed them the bottle that we were so proud of and began pouring out the glasses. Among most groups of drinking men there\u2019s always one who seems to dominate proceedings \u2013 you know who he is, he\u2019s the one who sits right in front of the interviewer and talks the loudest. It was vital for us to have him on our side and I kept my eye on him for his reaction. He drank it down, and then the researcher asked him what he thought. \u201cI\u2019m a pint drinker,\u201d he said, looking down at his schooner. \u201cAnd when I\u2019ve had enough beer I move to shorts, like Scotch or vodka.\u201d Oh dear. To make matters worse, being a talker, he went on: \u201cIt\u2019s a girl\u2019s drink,\u201d he said. There was an outbreak of nods and echoes of agreement among the other men. After this what man was going to openly lay claim to liking \u201ca girl\u2019s drink\u201d? It was an absolute no-no. But when we looked at their glasses every one of them had been drained. It might not have been their kind of drink, but there was nothing wrong with the taste.</p>\n                \n                                \n                                </div>                                                                 <div amp-access=\"authorized = true\">\n                         \n<blockquote class=\"inline__content inline__content--pullquote\">\n  The women\u2019s group\u00a0wasn\u2019t really any more encouraging.

One of them said \u201cIt looks and tastes like Kaolin &amp; Morphine\u201d, which was a popular medicine for diarrhea (it\u2019s still around).</p>\n                \n                                \n                                </div>                                                                 <div amp-access=\"authorized = true\">\n                         \n<figure class=\"inline__content inline__content--image\"> \n <amp-img alt=\"A women\u2019s focus group member compared the prototype Baileys to the taste of Kaolin &amp; Morphine, a popular medicine for diarrhea\" src=\"/polopoly_fs/1.3240937!/image/image.jpg\" layout=\"responsive\"/> \n <figcaption>\n   A women\u2019s focus group member compared the prototype Baileys to the taste of Kaolin &amp; Morphine, a popular medicine for diarrhea \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p class=\"no_name\">So the research didn\u2019t deliver a hugely successful result and I didn\u2019t feel totally confident about making the trip to Dublin on the back of it. Mind you, it was unlikely that IDV\u2019s Irish team would have been considered as research-obsessives back then. Concurrent with this \u201cexhaustive\u201d market research (three focus groups) we also had our real world test: two bottles behind the bar at the Allsop Arms just north of the Marylebone Road. I\u2019d chosen this pub particularly because it was on my way home from Tom\u2019s office at York Gate.</p>\n                \n                                \n                                </div>                                                                 <div amp-access=\"authorized = true\">\n                         \n<p class=\"no_name\">I\u2019d call in bright with hope, smile at the landlord and say, \u201cAny sales yet?\u201d He would shake his head slowly and carry on cleaning his pint pots as the two unopened bottles glowered down at me from their place on the shelf. I wondered if that was where our Baileys would forever stay, getting dustier and duller, having travelled only a few streets up from the offices of IDV. Then I called in one evening and one of the bottles had gone. It looked like the landlord would no longer give our Baileys shelf space but \u201cOh no,\u201d he said. \u201cTwo policemen came in this afternoon and demolished the whole bottle between them.\u201d</p>\n                \n                                \n                                </div>                                                                 <div amp-access=\"authorized = true\">\n                         \n<figure class=\"inline__content inline__content--image\"> \n <amp-img alt=\"The Allsop Arms in London, which stocked two trial bottles of Baileys, initially without success, until \u201cTwo policemen came in this afternoon and demolished the whole bottle between them,\u201d the landlord told the author\" src=\"/polopoly_fs/1.3240940!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/image.jpg\" layout=\"responsive\"/> \n <figcaption>\n   The Allsop Arms in London, which stocked two trial bottles of Baileys, initially without success, until \u201cTwo policemen came in this afternoon and demolished the whole bottle between them,\u201d the landlord told the author \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p class=\"no_name\">\u201cRight!\u201d I said to myself.

We collected the Baileys report from the market researcher alongside the Chiswick roundabout en route to Heathrow. We were cutting it fine for our big Dublin meeting. Tom drove and I leafed through the document in the car. It wasn\u2019t a comfortable read. \u201cThis isn\u2019t going to help our case,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s not all bad, but it isn\u2019t all good either.\u201d The bit about being a \u201cgirly drink\u201d was in there and so was the comment likening it to Kaolin &amp; Morphine. It was perfect ammunition for someone who wanted to kill the idea. The report contained nothing to reflect the earth-shattering idea we thought Baileys was now that we observed it in its full packaged glory. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we just put it away and not mention it?\u201d I said. Tom immediately agreed and I stuck it in my briefcase and left it there. It stayed in my briefcase until 1984 when I unveiled it at the 10th anniversary party. It got a huge laugh. The \u201cKaolin &amp; Morphine flavoured girly drink\u201d had sold about four million cases (48 million bottles) that year.</p>\n                \n                                \n                                </div>                                                                 <div amp-access=\"authorized = true\">\n                         \n<p class=\"no_name\">The weather in Dublin was as miserable as in London. We were met at the airport and driven to the Gilbeys\u2019 offices in the Naas Road, a dreary industrial district outside Dublin. I was excited rather than concerned. We had our kit: a couple of bottles of product that had been through the Research &amp; Development mill at Harlow \u2013 so it was vaguely shelf stable \u2013 and three fully-dressed bottles complete with beautifully printed labels and gold wax seals on the shoulders of the bottles which Tom had fashioned in his shed at home. They looked terrific and they looked real. We were relying on these bottles to clinch the sale. Showtime \u2013 at last.</p>\n                \n                                \n                                </div>                                                                 <div amp-access=\"authorized = true\">\n                         \n<p class=\"no_name\">Gilbeys of Ireland was a smallish outpost of the IDV empire. Most of the companies abroad at that stage were called Gilbeys after the founding fathers, the Gilbey family, who originally ran a coaching business in Essex in the 19th century. They were great Victorian traders and set up outposts across the British Empire. Gilbeys had a production plant where it bottled brands such as Smirnoff vodka and Gilbey\u2019s gin. It also distributed Croft Original sherry and J&amp;B whisky along with a large portfolio of wines. It was pretty successful for a small offshoot of a large international company.</p>\n                \n                                \n                                </div>                                                                 <div amp-access=\"authorized = true\">\n                         \n<p class=\"no_name\">Its main reason for commissioning a new product for export was that the Irish government had started giving generous subsidies for brands that were shipped to new markets across the world and Gilbeys wanted to capitalise on that. Because Ireland was then almost exclusively an agricultural economy, products with locally-grown ingredients were even better.</p>\n                \n                                \n                                </div>                                                                 <div amp-access=\"authorized = true\">\n                         \n<p class=\"no_name\">The Irish team, headed by their chief executive, David Dand, weren\u2019t hard-core, button-down 1970s marketing types with smart suits, matching shirts and ties and cylindrical slide rules. They were a friendly-looking bunch; guys that you might meet at a golf club or in the snug bar at the Shelbourne. In fact, David Dand wasn\u2019t very Irish at all; he had an accent that was light Dublin with a sprinkling of Manchester or Leeds. He was a bit \u201ctweedy\u201d. Keith McCarthy-Morrogh, the marketing director, was Irish upper class and could have been a character from The Irish RM by Somerville and Ross. With rakish curly hair greying at the temples, he and his Prince of Wales check suit were made for each other.</p>\n                \n                                \n                                </div>                                                                 <div amp-access=\"authorized = true\">\n                         \n<p class=\"no_name\">Doing a joint presentation with Tom was always challenging since he rarely stuck to the script and invariably stole most of my lines. Despite our somewhat unorthodox double-act, Tom and I managed a persuasive pitch for the Baileys idea. To help things along I cited my Kerrygold experience. Kerrygold was important to me and one of the keys to the development of Baileys. By that time the famed gold-wrapped butter had been celebrated as one of the European business successes of the 1960s and my association with it, I hoped, would add a bit of weight to our argument. I think it did.</p>\n                \n                                \n                                </div>                                                                 <div amp-access=\"authorized = true\">\n                         \n<p class=\"no_name\">Our foreplay over, the Irish team responded enthusiastically. They handled our bottle respectfully and even savoured the Baileys product to which Mac had applied considerable finesse since our initial International Stores effort. Much to my relief they didn\u2019t even ask if we had done any market research. It wasn\u2019t an issue in those days.</p>\n                \n                                \n                                </div>                                                                 <div amp-access=\"authorized = true\">\n                         \n<p class=\"no_name\">Lunch was pretty lavish, with several bottles of wine going down \u2013 and very good wine at that. Perrier hadn\u2019t become fashionable then, so people were still content to do real drinking at lunch time. We were in the wine trade after all. I suspect that the word went out to upgrade the vintages when they realised that we had delivered something that they really liked. A couple of bottles of Ducru Beaucaillou of a reputable year appeared and disappeared swiftly.</p>\n                \n                                \n                                </div>                                                                 <div amp-access=\"authorized = true\">\n                         \n<p class=\"no_name\">I\u2019m sure we had sworn everyone to secrecy on our side of the Irish Sea so that Baileys was a \u201ccold pitch\u201d to David and his colleagues. No one in Dublin knew what to expect from us. But the \u201cWexford Whispers\u201d were out and when I retired to the men\u2019s room I came across Tom Keaveney, the Gilbeys sales director.</p>\n                \n                                \n                                </div>                                                                 <div amp-access=\"authorized = true\">\n                         \n<p class=\"no_name\">He had not been at our pitch nor was he invited to the lunch but, via some magical Irish osmosis hotline, he knew about Baileys and the details of our presentation. We occupied adjacent troughs in the management washroom. He looked across at me \u2013 we\u2019d never met before \u2013 and muttered \u201cI\u2019ve heard about your idea.\u201d</p>\n                \n                                \n                                </div>                                                                 <div amp-access=\"authorized = true\">\n                         \n<p class=\"no_name\">\u201cOh yes?\u201d I replied. \u201cIt\u2019s not for the Irish market. Definitely not,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019ll never sell here.\u201d Somewhat chastened, I returned to the port and Stilton.</p>\n                \n                                \n                                </div>                                                                 <div amp-access=\"authorized = true\">\n                         \n<p class=\"no_name\">On reflection, it was quite an event, especially since we\u2019d gone to Dublin with a single idea: there was no Plan B and we didn\u2019t have any other ideas to offer. David Dand and his merry men could have squashed Baileys in an instant had they not liked it or felt it wasn\u2019t their kind of thing but these friendly, clubby Irishmen in their backwater offices in an industrial suburb of Dublin had the balls to say yes.</p>\n                \n                                \n                                </div>                                                                 <div amp-access=\"authorized = true\">\n                         \n<p class=\"no_name\">And it was not without risk: they knew full-well that they would have to build a plant to make it, they would have to invest in bottling lines and they would have to spend some real money on marketing. They were not a huge company, and it would strain their resources.</p>\n                \n                                \n                                </div>                                                                 <div amp-access=\"authorized = true\">\n                         \n<blockquote class=\"inline__content inline__content--pullquote\">\n  The first thing they did was to remove the word \u201cchocolate\u201d from the description Irish Cream Chocolate Liqueur \n</blockquote> \n<p class=\"no_name\">No matter how well an idea is received, it is a complex entity and changes are inevitably made. The Baileys team now had to make its own imprint. The first thing they did was to remove the word \u201cchocolate\u201d from the description Irish Cream Chocolate Liqueur. In those days, in the early 1970s, the word chocolate did not sit comfortably on the label of a premium liqueur brand. It also made the idea easier to copy. We were pretty happy with that decision. Nowadays things are different. The notion of \u201cKandy Coloured Tangerine Flake Triple-Distilled\u201d vodka from Vietnam would pass without anyone turning a hair.</p>\n                \n                                \n                                </div>                                                                 <div amp-access=\"authorized = true\">\n                         \n<p class=\"no_name\">As soon as they started making an imprint on this strange new idea they began to assume ownership. And once they owned it they would commit to it. But they were respectful enough to keep us informed of changes. And ask for our help when they needed it.</p>\n                \n                                \n                                </div>                                                                 <div amp-access=\"authorized = true\">\n                         \n<p class=\"no_name\">I got a call from David Dand in early July of 1974. It was about 9am and I was reading the sports page of the Guardian in the office. \u201cI\u2019m worried about the name,\u201d he said. \u201cOh my God,\u201d I thought. \u201cWe can\u2019t do another name now. It will take forever to get it through.\u201d My heart sank. David went on, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t mean Baileys. It\u2019s just that we can\u2019t just call it Baileys. It needs a first name or at least an initial.\u2019\u201d</p>\n                \n                                \n                                </div>                                                                 <div amp-access=\"authorized = true\">\n                         \n<p class=\"no_name\">I looked down at the paper and there was an article about a golf tournament. The Open was being played at Royal Lytham. The headline mentioned R&amp;A, golf\u2019s governing body, and I instantly blurted \u201cHow about two initials? How do you like the sound of R&amp;A Bailey? Think golf and the R&amp;A.\u201d \u201cGreat\u201d he said, \u201cI love it.\u201d And that was that and I went back to reading the paper.</p>\n                \n                                \n                                </div>                                                                 <div amp-access=\"authorized = true\">\n                         \n<blockquote class=\"inline__content inline__content--pullquote\">\n  R &amp; A Bailey were two brothers,\u00a0a distiller and\u00a0a dairy farmer. They had disliked each other for decades. Their father looked to bring them together as he reached his dotage \n</blockquote> \n<p class=\"no_name\">Yet as I thought about it after our conversation, a fantasy began to form in my mind. I could see them: R &amp; A Bailey were two brothers, one a distiller and the other a dairy farmer. They had disliked each other for decades. Their father looked to bring them together as he reached his dotage. He had a huge estate and wanted to keep it in the family. So he said to his sons \u201cIf you can find a way of working together, I\u2019ll leave you all my land\u201d. They sat down one night to try to work things out. A lot of whiskey went down when Robert, somewhat the worse for wear, mistakenly added some of his brother Aidan\u2019s cream to his tipple. He tried it and loved it. They made up and the rest is history.</p>\n                \n                                \n                                </div>                                                                 <div amp-access=\"authorized = true\">\n                         \n<p class=\"no_name\">Well that was my personal story. It helped to bring the idea to life for me. I had never intended for it to be used in public as it was a pure fiction. Interestingly, the \u201cMr R and Mr A\u201d idea was the theme for one of the early TV commercials for Baileys in the UK. It was pretty tame and utterly unbelievable, which goes to show that not all fantasies work in the real world.</p>\n                \n                                \n                                </div>                                                                 <div amp-access=\"authorized = true\">\n                         \n<p class=\"no_name\">Another \u201cBaileys moment\u201d was the discovery of an attractive, traditional restaurant in Dublin called The Bailey. I could imagine our drink being enjoyed there a long time ago. It gave a gentle nudge of support to our off-the-wall idea.</p>\n                \n                                \n                                </div>                                                                 <div amp-access=\"authorized = true\">\n                         \n<p class=\"no_name\">One of the serendipitous aspects of the Baileys development came from the fact that IDV had very recently been taken over by Maxwell Joseph\u2019s Grand Metropolitan Hotels group and it in turn also owned Express Dairies \u2013 and Express was a significant player in the Irish market. That meant that the cream that would go into Baileys could be bought not on the open market but from our own company.</p>\n                \n                                \n                                </div>                                                                 <div amp-access=\"authorized = true\">\n                         \n<p class=\"no_name\">We had inadvertently stumbled on the idea of the management theory called \u201cVertical Integration\u201d and, while it wasn\u2019t a completely new phenomenon in commercial circles, it was new to us. Even the original Baileys plant was based on a second-hand homogeniser bought from Express.</p>\n                \n                                \n                                </div>                                                                 <div amp-access=\"authorized = true\">\n                         \n<p class=\"no_name\">Back in Dublin, the launch party duly took place, as planned, at Tailor\u2019s Hall and those of us from across the water who were present, Tom, Mac, Alan Simpson and me, were told to sit at the back of the hall and keep quiet. Baileys was suddenly no longer our creation \u2013 it was theirs \u2013 and piqued as we might have been at the time, in hindsight they were right. If Baileys was to succeed, they had to feel that they owned it. I can remember being introduced to someone at the party as \u201cA man who helped out with the label design\u201d and while it rankled, I let it go.</p>\n                \n                                \n                                </div>                                                                 <div amp-access=\"authorized = true\">\n                         \n<p class=\"no_name\">One of the strange things about the success of the Baileys venture at that time was that nothing really sank in. We had made a presentation, people liked the idea and then it \u201cleft the building\u201d. We didn\u2019t really see it for a year. We got back to the question of solving new problems and looking for other business.</p>\n                \n                                \n                                </div>                                                                 <div amp-access=\"authorized = true\">\n                         \n<p class=\"no_name\">And it was to be about seven years before Baileys really appeared on the radar and looked like a success. I would show it to my sophisticated advertising friends and they thought it was a bit \u201cMickey Mouse\u201d and when I offered it up after dinner people usually looked at it sneeringly and said \u201clater perhaps\u201d. It lacked the savoir-faire of brands such as Cointreau with its sexy sophisticated ad campaign.</p>\n                \n                                \n                                </div>                                                                 <div amp-access=\"authorized = true\">\n                         \n<p class=\"no_name\">We presented the Baileys idea in 1973, it was launched in 1974 but it was another three years before it began to look like a winner. It was almost long enough for people to forget whose idea it was. I remember attending a few consultants\u2019 presentations where the protagonists claimed to have invented Baileys. I managed to keep my cool.</p>\n                \n                                \n                                </div>                                                                 <div amp-access=\"authorized = true\">\n                         \n<blockquote class=\"inline__content inline__content--pullquote\">\n  People nowadays often ask me how much money we get per bottle sold. My answer is that we were paid about \u00a33,000 all-in for the development \n</blockquote> \n<p class=\"no_name\">Nor was Baileys universally applauded in the elegant surrounds of 1 York Gate, IDV\u2019s head office. I can remember Tom telling me after the launch that someone had described me as having \u201cthe palate of a plumber\u201d. Given that plumbers earned a lot more than I did in those days, I took that as a compliment. People nowadays often ask me how much money we get per bottle sold. My answer is that we were paid about \u00a33,000 all-in for the development \u2013 though the company did keep employing me for another 30 years.</p>\n                \n                                \n                                </div>                                                                 <div amp-access=\"authorized = true\">\n                         \n<figure class=\"inline__content inline__content--image\"> \n <amp-img alt=\"Frank Fenn, chief executive of R&amp;A Bailey &amp; Co in 2003 with the six millionth box of Baileys Irish Cream in Dublin.

Its management saw it as a replacement for the Dutch egg liqueur, Advocaat, which it had distributed in the UK. In its campaign to compete with Advocaat, the first Baileys formulation was mixable with lemonade like an Advocaat \u201cSnowball\u201d. These were very early days for the formula and Mac and his colleagues were feeling their way.</p>\n                \n                                \n                                </div>                                                                 <div amp-access=\"authorized = true\">\n                         \n<p class=\"no_name\">The mixable Baileys product was a disaster. Cream and fizzy lemonade were uncomfortable bedfellows and the result of the mixture was an almost chewable dirty substance which some malicious barman dubbed \u201cGorilla Snot\u201d. Given my limited experience of simian effluents, I was not in a position to judge but the cocktail still exists \u2013 though the gorilla act seems to have been cleaned up.</p>\n                \n                                \n                                </div>                                                                 <div amp-access=\"authorized = true\">\n                         \n<p class=\"no_name\">Baileys kicked off in the UK and, perhaps less enthusiastically, in Ireland during 1975. The rest of the world was keeping its powder dry waiting to see what would happen. One encouraging fact was that Baileys was finding its way into executive briefcases as IDV\u2019s heavy mob toured the world.</p>\n                \n                                \n                                </div>                                                                 <div amp-access=\"authorized = true\">\n                         \n<p class=\"no_name\">A legendary anecdote in the brand\u2019s history is said to have occurred when Anthony Tennant (later knighted) took a bottle of Baileys to Abe Rosenberg, head of the Paddington Corporation in New York. Abe was a titan of the drinks industry and the man who had turned J&amp;B Rare into the biggest selling Scotch in America in the 1960s.</p>\n                \n                                \n                                </div>                                                                 <div amp-access=\"authorized = true\">\n                         \n<blockquote class=\"inline__content inline__content--pullquote\">\n  \u201cThe green background colour on the label reminds me of US uniforms in Vietnam\u201d he said.

He sipped at the muddy brown liquid with absolutely no enthusiasm. And then, it is said, he pronounced the immortal words \u201cThat shit will never sell!\u201d</p>\n                \n                                \n                                </div>                                                                 <div amp-access=\"authorized = true\">\n                         \n<p class=\"no_name\">Nevertheless, he launched it into the US later that year with the extraordinary advertising line \u201cThe Impossible Cream\u201d. In the words of S J Perelman in one of his advertising sketches \u201cthe idea had thematic milk\u201d. Despite its esoteric advertising, Baileys rose to become the biggest selling liqueur in the US \u2013 and indeed the rest of the world.</p>\n                \n                                \n                                </div>                                                                 <div amp-access=\"authorized = true\">\n                         \n<p class=\"no_name\">Meanwhile, Baileys had attracted attention in many places, being new and different, but it received its real impetus from an unlikely source \u2013 Australia. Whereas the wine and single malt buffs in the UK and Europe still held it at arm\u2019s length, the Aussies had few pretensions and the local managing director, after a visit to the Baileys\u2019 plant in Dublin, pronounced it in classic Australian fashion \u201ca bloody good drop\u201d.</p>\n                \n                                \n                                </div>                                                                 <div amp-access=\"authorized = true\">\n                         \n<p class=\"no_name\">He promptly ordered a full container, the contents of which flew off the shelves as soon as it landed. He ordered two more. Baileys became so popular that liquor stores carried signs which said things like \u201cIt\u2019ll be here in a week. Place your orders now.\u201d People knew exactly what they meant.</p>\n                \n                                \n                                </div>                                                                 <div amp-access=\"authorized = true\">\n                         \n<p class=\"no_name\">After only five years in the market, Baileys attracted as many as 75 competitors round the world. All of them were look-alikes at lower prices and some were even made with wine bases rather than spirit. There was Bayla\u2019s in Spain and Baitz\u2019 Island Cream in Australia and Irish competitors produced Carolans, O\u2019Darby\u2019s and Emmets. Everyone ripped off Bob Wagner\u2019s Irish pastoral idyll label design which became the Irish cream graphic generic. There was also a lot of vigorous activity within IDV to capitalise on the new technology and develop more products.
